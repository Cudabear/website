Two weeks already?  Time does fly.

If you've seen my update on FanFiction this will be old news to you, but I've slowed down on writing The Sun Chronicles for a short while to begin making progress on an original novel for publishing.  Don't get me wrong, The Sun Chronicles are immensely fun to write and now that I've got got both the second and third book planned out in my head its really hard not to just write like mad.  I decided it was time to give FanFiction a break and move onto something a bit more serious, though, and so I've picked up an idea I formed some time ago and went with it.

I hate to do this, but I really don't want to give away too much information about it right now, either.  I will say, however, that the working title right now is Tunnels.  That might stick... or it might not.   Really its too early to tell.  It's going to be, of course, fiction with lots of action and dark angst-y goodness, just like you've probably come to expect from me by now.

I'm not very far into it so far, only about 15,000 words.  I expect it to be upwards of 100,000 by completion, but we'll see how it goes.  I don't like to judge a book's quality on its length, but it is a planning point when I'm just getting started.  I'm really happy with it so far.

I'm making a small promise to myself to have it finished by the end this summer.  There's no saying how long it will take to be published after it is finished, though.  I'm not very familiar with the whole publishing process, so it might take months.  What I'll probably wind up doing in the mean time is self-publishing it as an eBook before waiting on a publisher to get back to me.

Of course, I'll update you guys when that happens.

I'm not putting The Sun Chronicles on total hiatus in the meantime.  I'm going to try to write at least one chapter per weekend while working on Tunnels so that I can keep that plot moving without forgetting where I was going with it.  Of course I love writing about my PoM universe, so it is doubtful I'd be able to stay away anyway, haha.

Not much else to say, so I guess I'll get back to writing!
