Well it's been a while since my last journal entry, so I figured I should write something.

<strong>WARNING: Spoilers for The Speed of Darkness</strong>

One important thing for me is that I listen to music when I write.  I can't stand to be in silence when I'm writing (or doing anything for that matter) so I always put on my favorite headphones and crank up the volume as I'm punching away at the keyboard.

The kind of music I almost always listen to is Trance.  Here's an example of it:  <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsXRyI2G1HQ&amp;feature=relmfu">[link]</a>

Trance for me is great for writing because I find it very mellow and natural.  It has this habit of morphing to the feeling of whatever I'm writing about at the time.  It can be sad when I'm writing a death scene, but also upbeat when I'm writing something a little more happy.  Needless to say it can also make excellent battle music.  Another bonus about this genre of music is that it almost never as lyrics or singers and it is always some overarching flow of constant rhythm.  It really helps me to be immersed in what I'm writing.

I usually listen to Digitally Imported radio, because their trance channel is one of the best and barely plays advertisements.  Sometimes they have radio talk shows on there, and when that happens I venture to Trance Euphoria, but that has lot of ads on it.  When I'm sick of listening to ads I usually just use youtube.

Near the end of writing The Speed of Darkness I started to look for scene specific tracks to set the mood before I wrote any particular chapter.  Here are a few key tracks I picked for major scenes:

Kowalski's Betrayal: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NYzzLZ6_BHk&amp;feature=relmfu">[link]</a>

The Temple of the Sun: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjcpDLN9Xe4&amp;feature=relmfu">[link]</a>

Manfredi's Death: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asHNeJ4mILs&amp;feature=fvst">[link]</a>

The last battle against Sarge: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ-QLl5qjLg&amp;feature=related">[link]</a>

And, one song that's been with me from the beginning that I would choose to represent The Speed of Darkness in its entirety: <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frKDjw-KET8">[link]</a>

That last one may seem just a touch happy, but that's exactly why I chose it.  I think its deep, thoughtful, a little dark and a little happy.  I really think it portrays Manfredi's life in one simple song.

So if you don't like to listen to music like this while you write, more power to you.  I strongly suggest you try it out, though.  It greatly helps me.  Some people, like my girlfriend, insist on having perfect silence though, and that's cool too.

Just a little insight to my writing world, I guess.
