More specifically, the editing is complete.

I've been working on and off on editing it and formatting it, since the version I posted on FF.net is pretty much raw manuscript.  I'm not going to take that one down and replace it, because I think it's great in terms of legacy, but I do now have an 'official' story with all of the chapters neatly formatted and edited.

I've printed out one copy for myself, and it's awesome to hold something I've put over 300 hours into.  I think it's excellent for my first novel.

If any of you would like a PDF copy for your E-Reader, feel free to comment on this journal with an email address, skype name, or really anyway you'd like me to send it to you.  Or you can just email me at cudascubby@gmail.com.
