Gosh, I spent so much time playing those old learning games on my dad's Packard with 16mb of ram and Windows 95, it's not even funny.  Regardless, this journal entry is to announce the start of the school year as well as serve as an update on what I've been doing in my life.

I started school last Tuesday, on the 4th, so I'm a little late.  I kept trying to remember to write one of these entries, but time kept escaping me.  Still, things are already going pretty smoothly.  My classes this quarter should be pretty easy, minus Operating Systems.  That class requires a fifteen page research paper mid-quarter, so that'll be fun.  Besides that, Database Systems and Software Requirements should be easy and straightforward enough.  At least they seem like they will be.  Besides that I've got Calculus 4 to squeeze in time for somewhere, but it's the final and arguably the easiest of the calculus classes at my school, so I'm not worried.  Oh, and a stupid little economics class.  All in all, things shouldn't be too bad.

I'm sure those of you who are reading this and following The Sun Chronicles are wondering what exactly is going on with it.  I haven't updated it in nearly two months which is interesting because I've been updating it at least once a week since I published the prologue.  The honest truth is that I've come to kind of a grinding halt on it.  More so than that, all of my writing has taken a fairly big hit this summer.  I've written a fraction of what I actually wanted to.  That means that even Tunnels has sat untouched for the last couple of months.

It was like writing was becoming very cumbersome, and more of a chore than anything.  I was never satisfied with what I wrote, and nothing was coming to me naturally as it normally does.  I found myself spending my time with my nose deep in thesauruses and dictionaries trying to find the most unique and complicated words I could instead of just letting the words flow through my fingers like they normally do.  It was troublesome, to say the least.  And that's why I've been working on that Portal/PoM crossover in my spare time.  I've only picked it up when I really felt like writing, and I've been making sure to stick to my roots.  It's worked, to say the least, and I'm really feeling the inspiration return to me to get back to The Sun Chronicles.

I'm not quite ready yet, though.  I want to work more on Tunnels, hopefully get another chunk done with it before I move back to The Sun Chronicles.  In addition to that, I really want to move away from the hasty write and instantly upload writing process I've had in the past, since my work throughout The Sun Chronicles has been good, but full of typos and contradictory statements that could have easily been fixed by a few quick proofreading runs.   Rather than uploading chapters each day when I've become a writing machine, I want to savor them a bit and space them out a few days each, to make sure they are properly edited before posting.  It really adds a sense of professionalism to the whole process.

That being said, I've pretty much got the entirety of The Sun Chronicles planned out in my head.  I've written down a rough outline, and it should facilitate the writing of the rest of The Power of Silence and the tackling of The Fall of Corruption.  I'm very excited to get going on the whole trilogy again, that's for sure.

As a side project, I discovered a game engine SDK entirely based on Java, so I've been playing around with that.  After spending a few hours with Blender to make a few easy models and reviewing my physics, calculus, and early programming notes to write some basic movement and trajectory algorithms, I've made a basic game.  In easy terms, I've got a balloon-like penguin that can shoot cubes at other balloon-like penguins.  I may pursue it more, but it probably won't be anything serious.  I just don't have the kind of time a project like that requires.  It's still fun, though.

Besides that I've just been spending time with friends, working, and relaxing.  Typical stuff.  Oh, and I've been spending some time in the family garden; the funnest time of all is the harvest!

The final thing I'll mention is that most things are finally planned for the wedding, hurrah!  That doesn't mean there still isn't a ton of work to do, however.  The clock is really counting down, though.  Only four months to go!

Here's to what I hope will be a productive and wonderful school year <img title=":) (Smile)" alt=":)" src="http://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/s/smile.gif" width="15" height="15" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="391" />!
