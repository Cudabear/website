And finally, it's complete! I can't believe that the novel is finally done. I hope you enjoyed the double update at the end. I was trying to hide the fact that the ending was so close as best as possible! I, too, hope they were as good as the chapters that came before them.

I'm going to have a more proper final word and analysis uploaded to my DeviantArt account within the next day or so, so search me up (Cudabear) if you'd like to read it. I will say this here, however. If you couldn't tell from the title change and the ending, that is.

There will be a sequel!

I'm not sure how much time I'll be able to devote to it, but it is going to be another full-sized novel. The first chapter should be up in a week or so, but after that I'm going to take some time to plan it out!

With that out of the way, let me get down to the real point of this bonus chapter—thanking the readers and reviewers! Without you guys I never would have finished this thing, and I'm very appreciative. I'll start with some personalized thank yous for my most loyal reviewers (in no particular order):

<strong>TheSkySpritsTalentShow: </strong>Thank you for being so kind and displaying such enthusiasm on each chapter I posted! It was such a pleasure to read your excited reviews. Even though they were short, they brought a smile to my face and helped me realize that this book actually isn't half-bad! Thank you again for being so loyal, and I hope you enjoyed the ending!

<strong>GoTeamSkipper:</strong> Always a pleasure to read your feedback after each chapter. One of the main things I looked forward to after posting each chapter was your loyal review! You always had the nicest things to say, and your really helped boost my confidence with this story. I remember you saying that on my daily chapter spree you weren't going to review<em>each</em> chapter, but you still did! I really do appreciate it. Thank you!

<strong>HipTurtle15:</strong> Thanks for being such a loyal reader and reviewer. You never seemed to log in to submit reviews, though, so I could never reply to them! You made me smile with your comments, though, and I thank you for that. It made me happy to hear that you enjoyed the story! Thanks again for being such a loyal reader.

<strong>Asmith137</strong>: You discovered the story a bit late into its life if I'm not mistaken, but you still took the time to write me some very detailed reviews! After that point, you wrote me very nice feedback on each and every new chapter. It was always very pleasant to get feedback from you, and I was always looking forward to what you had to say about the newer chapters. Thank you again for being so loyal and reading the entire book. You rock!

<strong>Pip4:</strong> I'm pretty sure you're my most long-term reader. If I'm not mistaken, you first reviewed this story sometime in early 2010, and you've stuck with it ever since. I do thank you for that! You always had some of the nicest things to say about the story and your feedback was always made me smile. It warmed my heart to still be receiving reviews from you, years after I had begun this story. Thank you!

<strong>PenguinsFan19:</strong> You're one of my favorite long-term readers. I remember receiving reviews from you back when this story was just beginning. You always had kind things to say about it, and your feedback was always a real confidence booster for me. It made me smile to see your quick review after the climax of the story, for I knew that you had read the entire book! That really warms my heart, so again, thank you!

<strong>Fishy716</strong>: You wrote some of the nicest, longest, and most helpful reviews. I enjoyed getting your well detailed reviews of the route I had taken through the story. They were mostly directed at the plot line itself, and where it was weak. I really do appreciate that, as it helps me strengthen what I do in future endeavors. I haven't received a review from you in a little while, but I do hope that you've enjoyed the rest of the story!

<strong>Sarahbelle Saunders</strong>: You are the one I have to thank most for getting be back into writing to the point that I finished this story. I was teetering on whether or not I wanted to devote time to writing again when you started writing me very nice reviews. You really helped to renew my love for writing and I can't thank you enough! You haven't reviewed for a little while, so I hope that you're doing well and if you have continued reading the story, that you enjoyed it. Thank you again!

<strong>ABSOLute Chimera</strong>: No clue if you will get this thank you, but it is well placed. Way back when I was starting this story, you stuck with me as I slowly posted chapters. Thank you so much for kind reviews on each chapter I posted, it really helped get me going and develop the plot. Thank you!

<strong>Minimewtwo</strong>: I'm unsure if you will get this thank you either, but again, a it is a well placed one. Thank you for sticking with this story for so long when it was in its early stages. I hope that you've continued to read, and even if you haven't you will get this thank you. You always said some of the nicest things to me, so thank you again!

<strong>HalfHuman123: </strong>Another thank you that may not be heard, as you mostly reviewed around two years ago, but I do still appreciate it. Thank you so much for all of your interest in this story as it began. It was always helpful to receive kind feedback on the first few chapters, so thank you!

<strong>Ggreen7295:</strong> Thank you for all of your early interest in the story. I'm also not sure if you will get this thank you, but I certainly hope you do. Your reviews were always very kind and always made me extremely happy to read. Thank you!

<strong>Gewlicious</strong>: Last, but not least, I thank the first person to favorite the story! You had some of the first reviews on the story, and you always gave me kind feedback. I'm not sure how far you read into the story, but I hope that you at least get this thank you. You really helped me get going!

Next, a blanket of thanks for everyone I missed, including you readers who quietly read and didn't review. Your interest is more than enough for me, as I write in hopes that people will read what I write. I hope you've all enjoyed this crazy ride as much as I have.

Finally, a quick dedication. A shoutout to my girlfriend for supporting me through writing this and helping me choose some major plot directions. I love you with all of my heart, and I can't thank you enough for being one of my biggest fans 3.

As I close out this final note, I'm going to list some stats. For my final word, I just want to say that I hope you've all enjoyed reading and that you'll return to read the sequel. Thank you all again!
