So, here's the in depth, personal analysis of my novel I promised everyone on FanFiction.  Now that it's finished, I'd like to give those of you who read it all they way through some background information and history on what exactly was going through my mind as I wrote the story!

<strong>WARNING: Spoilers!</strong>

Where to start?  I guess I'll start with the title.  The Speed of Darkness was the book's title from day one, even before I was completely sure what was going to do with it.  It comes from a Starcraft FanFiction novel by the name "Speed of Darkness".  I thought it was a very mysterious title, so I used it on my own book.  I added on "The Sun Chronicles" only recently as I began to think about a sequel.  More on that later, though.

So way back when I started in 2009, there wasn't a whole lot on Skipper's origin, or any of the characters for that matter, and I was sure that doing an origin story would be pretty cool.  The show has a lot more information on how the penguins came to the zoo since I began, but I originally stuck to my main idea, anyway.  My basis came, if you couldn't tell, from the fact that Skipper always mentioned Manfredi and Johnson in condescending ways.  (It wasn't until sometime in season 2 that the other penguins began referencing them, too.)  Because of this I definitely thought that those two would have something to do with Skipper's origin.

So, Manfredi came first.  I used, for the most part, his name as a guide on what his character would be like.  It seemed like the name that might be given to a gentle giant to me, so I took it and ran with it.  At the time I started The Speed of Darkness I was reading a novel by the name of "Indian Killer" for school, though I can't remember who the author was.  This novel was, in essence, a very dark serial killer mystery novel full of angst and death.  So of course, using it as inspiration, I made the prologue as dark and foreboding as I possibly could.

When I sat down to write the prologue I had no clue what was going to happen.  I really just thought for a moment about how a penguin would be driven to insanity.  Then, remembering how penguins mate for life in real life, I gave Manfredi a dead spouse and child.  The robot thing was just something I thought might be cool to add in at the time, but it came out to be one of the bigger plot areas!

After writing the prologue, I was entirely unsure how to transition into the novel.  The opening chapters were easy enough.  The first chapter with Marlene is one of my particular favorites, as I felt like I nailed her character and gave her a believable origin with her family and what-not.  This was also the time I thought about making the novel a Juliene story, as at the time, that pairing was unheard of.  I thought it could work and would be awfully cute, so I started it off right away.  It worked out really well, and I'm happy how it went.

Also on Marlene, I made sure to include the fact that she goes feral when outside the zoo.  I wanted to make it believable, though, and make it a source of conflict for the story.  It seems to have worked out well.  I'm glad I included it, though, as the show has actually shown her go feral several more times since that one episode.  It gives her character a bit of instability.

The first Skipper's log kinda sneaked in there when I wasn't looking.  I wrote it, but I didn't really know if I wanted to keep it.  It was an origin story, after all, and I was wondering how I wanted to tell what happened in Skipper's past.  The idea of replaying it directly from a tape recorder appealed to me, as Skipper is always seen recording his "Skipper's logs".  The idea dawned on me to include them in the story, so I did.  My original intention was to make them each their own individual chapter, and cycle them in about every 5-6 chapters.  Glad I wound up just appending them onto the beginning of other chapters, as that would have made the book comprised of a ton of short chapters.

Anyway, after the few opening chapters, I swapped back to Manfredi.  This is what I had been yearning for, as I had finished "Indian Killer" and I was ready to incorporate something more sinister into the story.  Using Manfredi's depression as a foothold, I made the scene with the pigeon.  The point of it was to be something of a conflict source, as Manfredi had killed an innocent animal.  It worked out when I referenced to it later in the story, but I wonder if I put it far too early.  Either way, it's there, and its one of the key points of the story.

I segued into realizing my story did not have a real antagonist.  Manfredi's not the best hero, yes, but he wasn't going to be the main antagonist.  That's when I thought about what Skipper, Johnson, and the others would be fighting in the Skipper's logs.  That's when the idea of Sarge popped into my mind.  I wanted to make a confident, smooth-talking, evil, and power-hungry villain.  I think I did a pretty good job there, with his first appearance being with Marlene.

Fast forward a few chapters, and you'd reach Manfredi and Skipper's first reunion.  Skipper and Sarge's similar looks where the source of this chapter.  It's kind of weak, I know, but I had to find some way to draw them together and not keep them together for long.  What a better way than to have Manfredi almost kill Skipper!  It worked out so perfectly, I feel, as Manfredi was so determined to kill him.  (Also, it is hinted that his target might actually be Skipper...)

Then pops in Alice.  I realized that, like Juliene, she is possibly the most ignored character in the fandom.  So why not give her a major role?  I had the idea of implanting some sort of tracking chip into the penguins already, so that the penguins would be able to track Skipper and later Kowalski.  Rather than just giving her a cameo, I developed her character and gave her a side-kick.  I think Andrew and Alice became two of my favorite characters and they really added to the story near the end.  They also acted as a source of conflict both between themselves and with the penguins.

Skipper's leaving was natural.  Of course he'd want to find Manfredi again.  This is where first ideas of Kowalski betraying the other penguins popped into my head.  Why Kowalski?  I don't really know.   I was going off of when he always flips out in the show when he can't think straight.  It made him seem a little over-emotional, yes, but his betrayal was just something I had to incorporate, for Skipper did not have any major conflict outside of Manfredi and Sarge.

So we go to Julien's party.  This was, of course, to continue hinting at the relationship of choice and give Skipper a chance to leave.  It also gave Sarge and his henchmen a chance to invade.  Good, right?  Their targeting Marlene was more of a plot decision on my part, as I feel it would be a reasonable assumption by Sarge.  This was also the first time I came up with his name, Sargent Caspian Fishslader.  Kinda sad that the main antagonist didn't have a name until almost chapter 20, eh?

Oh, this is the first time I thought about the Sun, too.  I wanted to have some ancient, powerful artifact to center the story around, so I put one in.  I tried to make it as cryptic as possible until the later chapters so that the reader would have no idea what it was.  I had no idea what it was going to be capable of, except powering the penguin base, until much later.

I enjoyed writing the next few chapters.  I thought it was really enjoyable to write the short blips of conversation that Manfredi and Skipper had in the alleyway.  I felt like I nailed it there, as if those things would actually be said in that predicament.  As for the other animals, I had to get the tracking device in their hands somehow, so of course they had to invade Alice's office to get it.  As for Julien knowing how to read in these chapters, that was something that I had to include because I was going with the "animals don't know how to read" plot and that I'd need at least one character who knew how to read later down the road.

Sarge's kidnapping of not only Kowalski but also Phil was to make it a little more believable.  Phil didn't do much besides be kidnapped, I know, but I feel he had enough screen time in the beginning chapters to make it worthwhile.  This initiates the first big fight chapter, and let me tell you, it came to me slow.  It actually took me eight months to write!  Crazy, I know.  It was good, though, and brought up the second half of the book nicely.

That's one thing I realized.  If you chop the book into two parts right around chapter 28, it flows really nicely.  There's new conflict resolved in each half.

Anyway, I didn't want to cram the entire two week boat ride into one chapter, so I used it to put some real character development.  I wanted to get everything out in the open for all of the characters so that I could focus more on the Sun when they got to Antarctica.  That's why I knocked Manfredi out for the two weeks, so I'd be able to describe what happened in the fish bunker (Something that has been built up) well.  The ability to replay his memories using his eye was kind of a random decision.  I just kinda thought, "He's a robot, so why not?"

Gosh, I was dying to write those chapters when I got to that point.  I had known exactly to write them out since like chapter 20, so I was pumped.  It's one of my favorite areas of the book, and I really feel like it brings Manfredi's character full circle.  It also brings the other animals into the conflict, mostly Skipper, as for the most part they were unaware of what happened.

Marlene and Julien also get a few cute chapters here.  I gave Julien a bit of an origin story, as well.  I really like imagining where the animals come from, can you tell?

Alice's general transition from hating the penguins to loving them was planned from her first chapter.  This is when I really felt like I was on shaky ground, though, and I felt like she bounced back and forth a bit too much.  Maybe you liked it, maybe you didn't.  It may need some revision when I ever get around to it.

The animals arrival to Antarctica is the start of Manfredi and Private's conflict.  At this point I knew I was going to kill of Manfredi at the end, and I needed to add something worthwhile behind it.  Some sort of deeper meaning, to show that Manfredi had changed for the better, even though he sacrificed himself.  I, of course, used Private for this, pulling the other animals in occasionally, so that they also had a role to play.

At this point is when I decided to devise what the temple would be like.  Something I regret is not describing it at an earlier point.  For the most part, it isn't even mentioned until Skipper says something like, "Oh yeah, there's going to be a deadly temple, too."  I really don't like that fact, but I needed an epic place to stage the final battles.  I think I did a pretty good job.  It was mysterious but also intimidating.

The doors with your greatest want in them were a little cheesy, I know.  I needed the characters to eat up some time so I could work out Kowalski's betrayal.  I think it's pretty cool, though.

Then we get to the climax.  It's a really big fight that stretches over about four chapters.  In my opinion, I really thought that it brought the book to a nice close.  Plenty of fighting, plenty of action, with enough actual talking in between fights to make it worthwhile.

Private's sacrifice by jumping into the Sun's blast was something I thought of last minute, as I began to think about a sequel.  I needed one of the animals to get hit for... specific reasons... and Manfredi as going to die, so that couldn't be him.  I chose Private because of how Manfredi and him interacted in the previous chapters.

Then comes the moment many of the readers were looking forward to the most--Sarge's defeat and death.  I didn't spend paragraphs and paragraphs talking about how Manfredi stabbed him, as I had origionally intended, as I felt like it was built up enough already.  Besides, I was trying to get across that Manfredi had changed slightly, and though he was still after revenge, he also wanted to protect his friends.  That's why he dove onto the Sun to guard them while they escaped.

Then the story is brought to a close.  I tried to wrap up all the conflicts at this point, and I felt like I did an okay job.  I didn't try to leave too much untied at the end, except for what happened in the epilogue, as that's what segues into the next book.  It'll be very important later, trust me.

Whew!  Okay, now that I've recapped the entire book with commentary, let me discuss the characters.

The key characters in the story, in terms of focus, were Manfredi, Marlene, Skipper and Kowalski.

Manfredi was going to be the main focus for the entire book.   I had planned it from the beginning.  It was his story, being told through both himself and the animals around him, no doubt about that.  I purposely put him through the most turmoil as I wanted him to be a very dark, brooding character.  He's also the main protagonist, but pretty much all of Skipper's team are as well...

I tried my best to make him look like as big of an anti-hero as possible.  I wanted him to be a character you'd root for as the reader, but still not really like him.  I really like how he turned out though, very deep and mysterious.  Just how I like it!

Marlene's character got way bigger than I had originally intended.  She was supposed to be a character that, for the most part, only was used to tell Manfredi's story.  She became much bigger, though, and I'm glad she did.  With her whole origin story, her family, her past, her problems with captivity, adventure, and so forth.  I feel like her discussion with Manfredi about failed choices and adventure at the end was one of the most important conversations in the entire book.

Skipper and Kowalski became a big source of conflict, as well.  Of course, Kowalski's betrayal as a result of Skipper burying his past was the reason for this.  I'm glad I did this, though, or else Kowalski didn't have a big role to play.  For the most part, Rico didn't either, but at least he was along for the whole boat ride.  Kowalski wasn't seen for half of the book, so I'm glad he became an important character.

Alice plaid a big role, too, but I feel like her chapters were more a sidebar.  Not really important to the main plot, but important enough to be worth mentioning.  Either way, both her and Andrew experienced changes in their characters.

Well okay, I feel like I've gone on long enough already.  This is my personal commentary on the book, and I hope you're enlightened a bit on what happened.  Maybe you even enjoyed the recap!

Before I leave this entry out, I'll give a brief mention to the change of title.  Of course the books are going to be The Sun Chronicles, what else would they be?  There are going to be three books I'm planning on.  A trilogy maybe, or maybe just three books.  I'm not sure if they'd be connected enough to be a trilogy, so we'll see.  The sequel is going to be awesome, though, hopefully as awesome as The Speed of Darkness.

A final, extra thank you to everyone who read the book and reviewed.  You guys rock!

Here's to hoping the second book doesn't take 2 and 1/2 years,
