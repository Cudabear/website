Here's a little back story on the ages of some of my OC's and my estimated ages for the cannon penguins in The Sun Chronicles.

A little bit of research showed me that emperor penguins live around 25 years on average in the wild, and up to 50 years in captivity.  They reach maturity after around 3 years and are ready for courting.

Taking that as a basis, you can guesstimate that, translated to human years, one penguin year is about 3 human years.  (kind of like how 1 dog year is like 7 human years)

With that in mind, here are the some ages of my OC's.  The death year is based on the fact that The Speed of Darkness took place in 2009 and The Power of Silence takes place in 2010, don't forget.  All penguins who are still alive have ages based on 2010 being the current date.

-------
Dmitri: 3 years (9 human years... I guess penguins mature a lot faster than we do.)
Melanda: 12 years (36 human years)
Irena: 4 years (12 human years)

Manfredi: 9 years at death (2009) (27 human years)
Sarah: 8 years at death (2007) (24 human years)

Johnson: 5 years at death (2007) (15 human years)

Sarge: 14 years at death (2009) (42 human years)
Thurgo: 8 years at death (2009) (24 human years)
Geir: 6 years (18 human years)

Edgar: about 15 years (45 human years)

------
So there's a taste of what my OC's are like in terms of age.  Here's what I think how old our four favorites are:
------

Skipper: about 11 years (33 human years)
Kowalski: about 14 years (42 human years)
Rico: about 9 years (27 human years)
Private: about 5 years (15 human years)

-------
So, in my opinion, Kowalski is actually older than Skipper.  Crazy, right?  There's a specific reason for that you'll see down the road in The Power of Silence.

Anyway, hope this was a little eye-opening on how old some of the characters in the novels are!
