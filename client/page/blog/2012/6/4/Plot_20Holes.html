Hello, everyone!

Looks like I let time slip a little bit and I forgot to write a second journal entry last month.  Things have just been going so fast lately for me, I'm not entirely sure what exactly happened in that four weeks...

In summary, a lot of working.  Working a full time job is more work than I was expecting, and I have little time at home to actually read and write like I normally would.  In addition I've been playing video games a bit more than I usually do lately, so that's been enjoyable.  I beat the game Dead Space recently.  Has anyone else played it?

WARNING: Spoilers for The Speed of Darkness and The Power of Silence below!

So the real point of this journal entry is to point out a few plot holes in my PoM fanfictions that became visible to me recently.

The first of which is, if you remember Edgar's first journal entry in PoS, the Temple of the Sun is positioned directly on top of the Earth's magnetic south pole.  This is a physical impossibility, considering that pole is located IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FREAKING OCEAN.  Perhaps I should have done a little more research about it...

The other plothole that I noticed was just how fast I was having my characters travel.  After a little research, using the distance between New York City and the nearest point on the coast of Antartica, I found that Skipper and the animals in SoD would have had to have been traveling at an average speed of 30 miles per hour to get there in just two weeks.  Not completely impossible, but that's comparable to how fast an average speedboat goes at full throttle.

To make things even stranger, for Irena and Dmitri to make it close to New York in only a week (as in PoS) they would have had to been traveling at around 60 miles per hour.  That's pretty unrealistic!

Finally, and probably the funniest of all is the fact that I described the trip from the coast of Antarctica to the Temple of the Sun taking around 36 hours or so.  Now, since where I previously said it was positioned is in the middle of the ocean, for this calculation I'm going to place it directly on the geographic south pole.

That means that in SoD, as Skipper's team was traveling to the Temple of the Sun, they were moving at 45 FREAKING MILES AN HOUR.  Just imagine them running that fast, and you'll laugh like I did, too.

There are many other plot holes in the story, of course, such as the fact that they'd never make it from New York to Antarctica on one take of fuel, why the humans never discovered the Penguin Base after it exploded, why the discovery of the Penguin  City wasn't more publicized, and so on.

I know I'm kind of nitpicking here because I mean, it's about talking animals.  Not to mention on the show, in Operation Antartica, Private and the seal SWAM from New York to Antarctica in only a day or so.  I'm not trying to beat myself up here, I just think it's funny to think about!

Hope that was interesting enough for all of you, and I hope you all are having a great summer!

(And happy 4th of July everyone!)
