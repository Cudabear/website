Merry Christmas, Everyone!

I've already been to my grandparents on Christmas Eve, and my parents this morning. Now I'm just waiting to head over to my nearly-in-laws for the big Christmas dinner.  I can smell the ham cooking in the oven from here, and it smells lovely.  It is all very humbling, as Christmas should be.  It's the yearly reminder of what's truly important in life: family.  That and something about a baby being born in a manger a long time ago.

This Christmas is a new experience for me; my nearly-wife and I celebrated it together.  Because of the fact that our wedding is a mere eleven days away we didn't really have money to buy gifts this year, so we scavenged up enough cash to buy baking supplies and baked.  We assembled over a dozen gift boxes full of a variety of holiday treats, and I don't think I've ever been as happy.  Food is always a great gift, for one thing, but there's something special behind the fact that they were hand-made.  Something that's hard to name... so I'll call it "homeliness".  Not to mention they were a blast to make!

I'm looking forward to the next year with great anticipation.  My wedding is of course, on the 5th, and after that my wife-to-be and I will have a rocky road ahead of us for the next few months.  We're following what we strongly believe is a calling from God to live and serve in the downtown Milwaukee area.  That means that we'll be bringing a lot of factors into our lives from living downtown that otherwise we wouldn't have to deal with.  All the while we'll still have to concentrate on school and work; and the work will be longer hours than I feel is healthy.  That doesn't even include some related drama that's been knocking us around for the last month or so, when we first discovered this was our calling.  God is good, though, and I know He'll be looking out for us.  If we can make it through the next six months in relative harmony, I know we'll be able to do some great work downtown and on our university campuses.

For now, I'll just bask in the peace and warmness of Christmas and my holiday break from school.  Besides putting the last few touches on the wedding, this is likely to be my last decent break from working my fingers to the bone until spring break; maybe even until summer.  I'm not going to let the holiday season slip away, though.  I'll be sure to take a few minutes to sit, open up a good fanfiction, and read; maybe even crack open my laptop and write a bit.  It'll be pleasant.

Until 2013,
