Wow, I've really been neglecting my journal.  Can't really blame it on a busy summer, more or less just because of the fact that I've constantly been distracted.  That goes for my writing, too.  I just haven't been able to sit down and write a proper chapter for TPoS because whenever I do within a few minutes my mind is always going crazy thinking about unrelated things.  As a result, my writing seems distant and rushed.  It's really disappointing for me; perhaps I'll be able to write better material this fall.

The main objective of this entry is to attempt to obtain a grasp on everything that has been going on in the world as of late.  Approximately two hours ago in Oak Creek, Wisconsin there was a shooting at a Sikh temple that resulted in seven people dead, including the suspected shooter.  Oak Creek is a fifteen minute drive from my doorstep, which is really frightening.  I'm actually watching the news report right now.  With the Colorado shooting fresh in my mind, I'm left wondering what exactly is happening in the world.

In my fiction writing I enjoy making worlds where there is these kinds of conflict, but I do so because I respect how terrible these kinds of events are and how it affects those people involved.  For example, in The Speed of Darkness, I described Manfredi to have been driven to insanity because his family was murdered by the army he once stood alongside.  It might have been a fictional situation, but its based on reality.  It's very tragic when people loose the ones they're closest to in an event like that and they loose their rationality and their faith in the world.  It is good to acknowledge these events for the fact that they occur in reality, not in fiction.

That's one thing that makes me so interested in writing stories about these situations: I strive to understand what pushes these people to take up a weapon and slaughter people that they've never even met before.  I have no clue why a mentally rational person with at least some sense of morality would do such an evil thing.  As we know from the Colorado incident, however, very intelligent people with no history of criminal activity or mental instability are very capable of these activities.  James Holmes spent his life learning how to understand the way the human mind works and must have been aware of what he was doing.  He premeditated it and executed his plan flawlessly.   The shooter that was killed by police at the Sikh temple must have been in a similar situation.  What in the world could be so terrible as to push a man to do that without at some point sitting back and thinking, "there's nothing killing innocent people is going to accomplish?" I have my personal explanations, but I'll reserve them for the sake of the length of this entry.

Between the Colorado shooting and now this one, there have been news stories about a couple of foiled attempts by people to perform mass shootings on the same scale.  It makes me wonder what exactly is happening in the world.  These kinds of events have been occurring since the beginning of time across the planet, but in the recent years, and more specifically recent months, they really seem to have been picking up.  Everything from the riots in Russia and London to this hometown tragedy just a few miles from where I live.  Maybe it's just speculation, but even if it is it's very scary.

Just a few thoughts about what has been going on.  My thoughts and prayers go out to those who lost their lives at the temple in addition to their families.
