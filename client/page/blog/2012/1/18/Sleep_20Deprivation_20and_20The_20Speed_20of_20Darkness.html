Well it's around 4:30 in the morning where I live, and I can't sleep.  I decided to punch out one of these journal things as long as my mind won't stop its senseless buzzing.

Of course, I can't stop thinking about my Penguins of Madagascar fanfiction, The Speed of Darkness.  Those of you who read this are probably at least familiar with it, so I won't go into much detail.  I have to say, particularly in the last two months, I have really grown to be proud of it.  Its story line is one of the most well-designed and intricate that I have ever developed.  The characters are deep, and have plenty of "screen time" for conflicts and actions to change them.  The plot is slow moving, yet with just enough happening to hold the reader's attention.  There's plenty of action, but enough dialog to make it worthwhile.

I'm not trying to blow my ego up too big here, but after spending 150+ hours ticking away at a keyboard over three years, I hope you can see how a project like this can really grow on a person.  I am only mildly concerned that it's hindering my ability to sleep, as I am always thinking about how the next chapter will go.  It's exciting, to say the least.  Some of my best thoughts come at night.  Sometimes I find myself on the brink of dreamland when I hop up and scribble some plot down so I won't forget it by the morning.

All good things must come to an end, though.  With breaking 100,000 words on The Speed of Darkness, I realized I need to start wrapping it up.  So I sat down one night and planned out the entire rest of the plot, chapter by chapter, until I had a sort of wireframe that I was happy with.  Now I know exactly how many chapters there are going to be, and about how many more words I get to write.  It's disappointing that it is going to be coming to a close soon, but that also means I will be able to display my first hand-written novel as 'complete'.  It's an invigorating idea, and I can't wait to pass the finished book onto friends and family to read.

Other thoughts related to finishing this novel have surfaced as well.  Mostly, the fact that getting my work published is basically a no-chance situation is a little disheartening.  I knew from the beginning that it was my choice, though.  Writing fanfiction is just too much fun.  What makes it so much fun is posting each new chapter as soon as they are complete, reading reviews, and looking at the hit counts.  I don't think I'd enjoy writing a book from cover to cover without any major input from readers.  The day I started thinking about The Speed of Darkness I knew that it was either write about PoM (which I absolutely adore) or try to come up with an entirely different universe that worked for the story I had laid out in my head.  I went for the best choice, of course.  (Which, thanks to all of my loyal readers, was a truly rewarding decision!)

Back to ending The Speed of Darkness.  I have been writing at a steady rate of one to two chapters per week since last December.  This is slower than I'd like, as it seems that I am always ready to write the next chapter immediately after finishing a different one.  However, I am very limited by school and work.  Those two commitments alone eat up practically all of my waking hours.  It's definitely nice to get away once and a while and punch a chapter out.  With that in mind, however, I transition into my quarterly break.

At my college I attend on a quarterly schedule.  That means I am in school for three quarters, and on summer break for the fourth.  I am currently wrapping up my winter quarter now, and after finals next week, I am home free until the spring quarter begins 11 days later.  Now, what does this mean for The Speed of Darkness?

I'm going to be uploading a new chapter each day while I'm on break.

Or at least try to.  Beginning on Thursday, February 23rd and ending on Sunday, March 4th I'll have a brand new chapter out each night.  I'm hoping the task won't be too daunting as the story arc reaches its climax.  We'll see how it goes, and hopefully you can enjoy a brand new chapter each night.

In addition to that fact, I've set a personal goal to be finished with the story by the end of March.  It doesn't seem like it will be to hard to reach if I can release those eleven chapters of break.  Funny idea is that it will be just shy of two and a half years after beginning the project of writing the novel.  Mind you, I'm not trying to give away any information on the exact number of chapters left.  Just know that I've got it all planned out now, so I hope that its smooth sailing from here on out.

As for now, I should really get to bed!  I've still got finals starting on Monday, so I need to get some studying done over the next two days.  Here's to a happy break of writing!
