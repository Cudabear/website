Hello, hello!

So have you ever had a week where it seems everything decided to happen at once?  I've got one of those coming up.  I've got all four of my midterms interspersed between Monday and Tuesday.  *faints*.  Just gotta tough it out this weekend with lots of studying and I'll be good to go (hopefully!)

So National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo) is coming up next month.  For those who don't know, it's basically this yearly event where a ton of writers get together and vow to write an entire 50,000 word novel within the month of November.  It's been going on for many years now, and it's something I've always wanted to participate in.  I think I'll finally go for it this year!  Unfortunately that means that The Sun Chronicles won't see the light of the, well... sun, for probably another two months.  It's unfortunate, but between school, work, and this new goal, I'm strapped for time.

If you're interested in participating, check out NaNoWriMo at <a href="http://www.deviantart.com/users/outgoing?http://www.nanowrimo.org/">[link]</a>.

Also, I just found out today that there will be no new Nostalgia Critic videos <img title=":( (Sad)" alt=":(" src="http://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/f/frown.gif" width="15" height="15" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="380" />.  I can't say I wasn't expecting it at some point... there are only so many bad, nostalgic movies.  I guess we'll see what Doug Walker has planned next for Channel Awesome; I know it'll be just as entertaining.

Hope everyone is having an excellent autumn!
