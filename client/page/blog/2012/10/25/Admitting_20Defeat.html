Well here I am, did you miss me?

Probably not.  If you're curious as to where I've been, it'll be safe for you to know that I've been busy exploring the Martian surface... on Google Mars.  But seriously, I've been following my normal school routine, and that eats up most of my time.  When I have a free moment or two, I've been playing a lot of RuneScape.  And doing some NaNoWriMo, which is what this entry is about.

At the beginning of the month I took on a commitment that I was pretty excited about, and that was to write an entire 50k word novel in one month.  I knew it would be hard between school and work, but I also knew I'd have quite a bit of time off for Thanksgiving break that I could use to catch up.  Unfortunately, even though the month is already over, I need to admit defeat.

I've reached about 28k words so far, meaning to reach the goal by the end of the month I'd need to write over 4k a day.  I might be able to do that if school wasn't starting, but even then it's unlikely.  The really silly thing about it all is that I've collectively had enough time to write the thing, but I just didn't manage it effectively.  I wound up not writing many times when I could have squeezed in a few hundred words, which would have really added up.  I found it hard to start writing at those times, though, and I didn't.  Mix that with a couple of busy weekends (fiance's bridal shower, party, thanksgiving) and I've got a couple of plateaus that just killed me.  When I actually did sit down and start writing I usually pounded out 3k words or so, but there were days at a time when I didn't even touch the book.

Even though I didn't complete NaNoWriMo, that doesn't mean I won't finish the short novel I was writing for it.  It's called Volition, and I really like it so far.  If I keep going at a steady pace, I'm hoping it should be finished by mid-December.  I suppose late is better then never!

With that in mind, I should say that it will be safe for me to return to The Sun Chronicles after the new year.  I know It's already been a LONG four months without an update, and I hate to push it off for another one, but I assure you it will see some love soon.  I'm getting really excited to hop back in.  I think my hiatus is just about over.

Oh, and Impetuous Acumen should be finished soon as well.  It's just got one more part to go.  After that I've got an idea for another crossover brewing in my head that I may write in a similar five-part fashion as a break from The Sun Chronicles.

Hope everyone had a wonderful Thanksgiving,
