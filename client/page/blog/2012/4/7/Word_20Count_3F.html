Hello, hello!

So I've only got two weeks of classes and final exams standing between me and three months of summer vacation!  And by 'summer vacation' I mean sitting in a dark room with my laptop and music and pounding out The Sun Chronicles and Tunnels.  Well, that and showing up for work occasionally!

I wanted to write this quick entry to express something that's been on my mind as of late:  word count in novels.

One thing that I always didn't like about FanFiction.net is that it lists word count for EVERYTHING:  stories, individual chapters, writers, ect.  I feel it really puts a lot of weight on something that should hold absolutely no significance when judging how good a story is.  Word count can be a good indicator of a story's length and possibly the time to read it, but that's about all.  That's the only benefit I can see from listing it everywhere, and that's not much because listing it often traps authors like me into not posting chapters until they are of adequate length and that usually involves filler content that is just boring.

As a statistic, the word count is interesting.  It does carry some sense of achievement with it so I do like to look at it, but for nothing more than that.  For example: how many words can I write per hour?  For me it's around 950-1150 depending on what I'm writing.  It doesn't mean what I'm writing is good or completely garbage, though.

I was curious recently so I did a little research on average fiction novel lengths and I came up with some interesting information.  I have known for some time that book printers try to aim for around 250 words per page in your average paperback novel.  With that in mind I found out that The Speed of Darkness is around 600 pages; as long as the longest Harry Potter books!  I also found out that the Hunger Games trilogy is only around 1100 pages for all three books combined, or around 225k words.  That means that each book only possesses half the length of my novel, and The Power of Silence is already as long as a novel... and its only half done!

Its kind of interesting to think about where my writing stands among the others, I guess.  It seems I tend to write very long, drawn out scenes that I should probably shorten.  Or maybe I shouldn't.  You see, that's where this problem with word count stands:  it is nothing more than a statistic.  It doesn't say anything about a novel's quality.

That being said, I try not to dwell too much on word count.  I write until I feel I've covered everything that needs to be covered in a chapter, and though my average chapter length has been steadily increasing lately, I'm not worried about it.  Word count is only a statistic.
