So on the 20th of May I officially entered the second decade of my existence here on the planet Earth.  And how was the experience of transitioning into an entirely new threshold of age?  ABSOLUTELY-FREAKING-WONDERFUL!

I'm not sure how far the Dave and Buster's arcade chain has gone in terms of a franchise and locations, but they've got one branch near my house here in Wisconsin.  I mentioned one day that I wanted to go there sometime, and my girlfriend decided that she'd surprise me with a trip there on my birthday.

Dave and Buster's is like an arcade directed at adults but with plenty of fun stuff for kids, too.  They've got a bar and a full service restaurant but also an arcade with just about every machine imaginable.  They've got a retro section with the original Galaga and Pac-Man and that kind of stuff.  They've got a massive Connect-4 machine.  They've got a Dance Dance revolution cabinet.  Just about every type of those silly little ticket games.  Fruit Ninja, Guitar Hero, House of the Dead, Rambo, Mario Kart, Skeeball, ect.  Needless to say I burned through about $60 of tokens in just under two hours.

I got most excited when I first walked in and saw the prizes.  I never really cared about ticket games and prizes but when I walked in and saw an assortment of Penguins of Madagascar plushies I almost screamed.  Then, when my girlfriend heard about them, I took her to see them.  Then, when my cousin did, I took her.  Then, when my girlfriend's little sister wanted to see, I took her.  After that the clerk at the desk noticed me going to look at them so much, and when she found out it was my birthday, she gave me a free Rico doll!

After that point I made sure to make it my goal to collect all four penguins.  It wasn't that hard when the manager of the place saw my girlfriend working at a machine and won the jackpot for her, bagging us a Kowalski plush.

Then we took a break for some cake and presents.  That was when the revealed the cake that you can see in the pictures in my scraps.  Talk about an amazing cake!  It was red velvet, my favorite, with buttercreme frosting.  The Penguins were made of chocolate rice-krispy treats with fondant on the outside and some wierd, edible black paint.  The cake was delicious, but I didn't want to eat the penguins, haha.  Eventually I manned up and bit Skipper's head off (which still gives me some chills!).

For gifts I got a Julien plushie, a Private plushie, a Skipper plushie, and a bunch of little plastic Penguins of Madagascar figurines.  With Kowalski and Rico already in the bag thanks to the generous owners of the place, I had the whole crew!

Then it was back to the arcade, and I have to say I played so much Dance Dance Revolution that I think I suffered a heart attack at some point, but it didn't stop me.  After I got too tired to keep playing that game I spent the last of my tokens on games that award tickets and attempting to get something nice for my girlfriend.  She picked a calculator and some file folders (they were actually really cool... even though they're just office supplies...) so we both got some stuff to take home.

At home the party wasn't finished.  Got to hang out with a friend from school and family.  We played a little Dance Dance Revolution (can you tell I like that game?) and watched The Return of the Revenge of Dr. Blowhole.  Nothing makes me laugh as hard as PoM, that's for sure.

In the end I got all four penguins as plushies, a Julien plushie, a bunch of little plastic figures, a bean bag chair, a bunch of birthday cards, a delicious cake, and a time I'll never forget.  My family is the most awesome bunch of people in the world, that's for sure.  Extra big thanks and hugs to my girlfriend and my mom for making my cake, and Dave and Buster's for making my party that much more fun!
