This entry is kind of a dump of everything that's going on, so bare with me.

First off I'm well done with school, so that's nice.  I was hoping I'd be able to put a lot more time into writing so far this summer, but with work and wedding planning (more on that later) I've found very few chances to sit down and type out some writing.  I'm a little bit disappointed because I was so excited to get going on The Power of Silence and Tunnels.

Part of the fact that I haven't gotten a whole lot of work done on writing is just because I've had a massive case of writer's block.  Not so much that I'm not sure what exactly I want to write, but that it just hasn't been as fun as it normally is.  I figured I just needed a little break, and then I'll jump back into it.  I even planned out the rest of The Power of Silence on a chapter-to-chapter basis, but I'm still not super excited to write it out.  It's just not flowing as well as I had hoped, though I was rereading it a little bit earlier today and that's not entirely true.

There is the issue of the fact that I would like to have a novel self-published by the end of the summer, too.  Tunnels is coming along pretty nicely; I'm currently almost finished with part 1 of 3.  I'm really liking it so far, though it comes to me very slowly.  Nonetheless I'm pumped to have it finished and get out into the market!

So, yeah.  Wedding planning.  It's a ton of work, let me tell you that.  For those of you who don't know, I got engaged about two weeks ago today.  I'm very excited to be starting my life together with my high school sweetheart, but Lord is planning hard.  We want the big day to be special, but that means picking catering, bakeries, locales, dresses...  so much that I'm almost ready to explode!  And we've only been engaged for two weeks, can you believe that?

It's not as bad as it sounds.  I really do enjoy it, and I can't wait!  As for a date, we picked January 5th, 2013.

As for current affairs, I'm very excited to see Madagascar 3 tomorrow!  We're of course going on opening night; wouldn't miss it for the world!  I've never been a huge fan of Marty, Melman, Gloria and Alex, but that doesn't mean I still don't love those guys, too.  The real reason I'm excited to see it is of course for the Penguins and Julien, who I hope will be making an appearance.  (I've been avoiding trailers to not spoil it.)  I'm a little disappointed that they stuck with the movie look for the penguins, even though I'm sure most of the fans would have appreciated the PoM look for them (Rico's scar, subtle differences in Kowalski and Private, flatter head on Skipper), but it will be nice to see what happened after Africa.  Its just a little bit of a shame because I know they didn't really try at linking the movies to the show.

So I've got a lot to look forward to this summer! Hope everyone else enjoys theirs, as well!
