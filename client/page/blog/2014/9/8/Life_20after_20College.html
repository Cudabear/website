Four months without a new blog post?  I think that's a new low for me.  So, what has been going on in the meantime?

First and foremost, Ludum Dare 30.  I made <a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld30" target="_blank">The Bunny Theory</a>, a game that I had really high hopes for but I realized fell quite flat.  I had planned to do a more typical postmortem for it, but I was pretty discouraged by the whole event and how my ratings turned out, that I kept putting it off.  Now, it's probably to late to be of any use, which is a shame.  I have an idea of what went wrong, but I'm not sure I'll be able to use it to improve for next time.  After doing so well in LD29, this game kind of temporarily crushed my dreams a bit.

The funny thing is, I'm not entirely sure why it did.  The game certainly didn't do <em>bad</em>, it just didn't do very good.  After <a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld29" target="_blank">The Clone Escape</a> finished in the top 10%, however, I wasn't quite as satisfied with a top 50% finish.  Looking back, it makes a lot of sense why The Clone Escape did much better than The Bunny Theory.  The Bunny Theory hardly had any content, just one mechanic and one enemy type to grind out until you got bored of it.  The Clone Escape had a small story, great mechanics, and a good sense of progression.  I'll take this difference to heart moving into Ludum Dare 31, which of course I'm going to participate in.

What will I be doing in the meantime, then?  NaNoWriMo, of course!  If you're not familiar with NaNoWriMo, it stands for <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org" target="_blank">National Novel Writing Month</a>, which is basically a month where everyone participating sits down and writes a 50,000 word novel within the space of a month.  There's a whole community around it and everything, and it's a ton of fun!

I actually participated the last two years.  The first year I participated I wrote the first two thirds of <em>Volition </em>before giving up with only 15,000 words to go.  I had fallen behind and lacked the motivation to continue it.  I actually do want to finish this novel eventually, since I was very happy with the way it was turning out.  That's the only reason, actually, that I haven't posted it up for download on the website.  Maybe in the next year I'll finally get around to finishing it to polish it up.<em>
</em>

During my second year I had a great idea for a <em>Penguins of Madagascar</em> fanfiction about zombies and the futility of fearing death.  I started strong, wrote the first 6,000 words within the first weekend, then hit a wall.  I was in arguably the hardest quarter of my schooling, while simultaneously working 20+ hours a week at my internship to help support my new, independent life with my wife.  Unfortunately, writing a book just wasn't going to happen.  This is another book I eventually want to complete, but it's probably not going to happen for a long time, especially because I want to focus on writing something I can actually self-publish and get out there as a ebook.

This year I've got another great idea, this time focusing on a futuristic, dystopian city akin to series like <em>The Hunger Games</em>, <em>Divergent</em>, and <em>Maze Runner</em>.  It may be a hackneyed setting now, but I've got a pretty unique plot with challenging themes that I think will make my novel differentiated enough to be worth writing.   I have yet to map out the entire story and characters, but I'm going to get started on it right away so I'm ready to start writing right on November 1st!

So, then, what have I been doing since graduation (and simultaneously my last blog post)?  Video games, mostly.  I often find myself in a love-hate relationship with video games.  I receive great pleasure from playing them, particularly with loved ones, but after several days of playing video games and doing not much else with my free time, a unique feeling of uselessness comes about.  It's sort of like, sure, I'm having good experiences with the video games, hearing the stories the games are telling, building cool things in other games, making progress in yet other games.  But video games are temporary.  At the end of the month, year, whatever, those bits and bytes will be forgotten, only to surface again in X-number of years to provide some feelings of nostalgia.

I had a brief stint with <a href="http://www.runescape.com" target="_blank">RuneScape</a> again, particularly the "oldschool" version they released recently, which replicates the experiences I had in my early highschool years while playing.  It was a blast, but under the surface all I was really doing was working to increment numbers in a database.  So, I still follow the game (updates and such) but I think I've finally left it for good.  It got well over 200 days of my life already.  I needed to leave eventually.

My most recent addiction has been <a href="http://www.minecraft.net" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>, a game I spent lots of time with in my Freshman college year but haven't really touched since.  I purchased a realm, or a virtual server, for some close friends and family to play on with me.  It's been quite fun, and a little more rewarding because the things I build have a tiny bit more substance to them, in addition to being able to play with family and friends.  Even then, it has dominated my interests as of late, and it's time to tone things down a bit.  I'll still play, and soon I want to make videos of our server, but I really need to get started on my other projects eventually!

Other than those two games, it's been a few single-player story driven games that I've been playing.  They're always really fun, since it's a bit like experiencing a movie.  The most recent one I played was Metro 2033, a post-apocalyptic game about surviving underground in the Russian subway system.  I have actually recently bought a much more powerful computer than my school laptop, so it's been pretty cool to play with high graphic settings.

So, NaNo this year?  Totally going to happen.  I've got a couple of other family members interested in it as well, so we're planning to get together often and chat about our progress, and write together.  It should be enough encouragement to make it through!  And--I don't want to get ahead of myself here, but--maybe in the next few months you'll finally be seeing a published ebook from me.

All it takes is a little bit of dedication.

(And of course, not allowing Video Games to eat all my time...)
