Hey everyone,

Yet another simple status update here.  I like to use these posts to gather my thoughts and figure out exactly where I am and what I want to be doing.  So I apologize for the complete lack of anything actually useful on this blog.  In this post I want to describe some things I've got planned over the next few months.

Firstly, writing.  I did finally get my Chromebook, and I love it.  It's so great for mobile computing.  I can charge it up overnight and it lasts most of the day.  I can sit and write basically anywhere is comfortable.

It beats the pants off of my ten-pound dinosaur of a school laptop.  I <em>do</em> still need that laptop though (unfortunately) so I will be holding onto both.  However, I am really excited to do some writing in the coming weeks.  <em>The Power of Silence</em> is damn near 2 years old at this point, so it's about time to finish it up!  I can count the number of chapters that remain on one hand, so we're really close to the end.

In addition to writing whenever I am motivated, however, a buddy and I have a great idea for a HTML5 canvas game involving zombies.  We plan to use the Google Web Play framework, and have the game targeted to casual gamers.   Things have just been started but we're very excited to be moving forward with the project.  The game will likely look sort of like my PenguinsHTML alpha I was building a while back.

When not working on that project, I also want to participate in the next Ludum Dare.  It's coming up at the end of April; a fairly long ways off but I'm sure it will be here in an blink.  I want to prepare a little more for this Dare than I did for last; namely making my splash screen so that it doesn't look as rushed as it did.  I'm sure what I <em>did</em> learn last time will be invaluable, as I plan to use the Phaser JavaScript framework once more.

This brings me to the last thing I would like to do in the coming months: programming tutorials.  I started this blog in hopes of doing writing guides and informational posts about writing, and hopefully there will be a few yet to come.  I'm an engineer at heart, though, and while I can offer basic guidelines for aspiring writers, I don't think I can really offer anything unique.  What I would really like to do is programming tutorials; namely web development.  I want to start with a Phaser introduction in the coming weeks, so be on the lookout for that!

Oh, and I recently accepted a job offer for a full time position, so that's nice.  It feels really good to not have to worry about what I'll be doing after college.

That about sums up this post.  See you soon (hopefully).
