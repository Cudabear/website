... but it's still quite a ways off.

Hello, everyone.  This will be yet another meta update of sorts.  I haven't really done anything noteworthy since winter vacation, anyway.

My Winter quarter is coming to a close, which means I only have one more quarter to go before I'm done with school forever.  The last quarter will be significantly easier than this quarter as well, thanks to less credits, and a lack of any labs.  I still have to do my Senior Design project, but I've gotten pretty used to logging my ten weekly hours for that already.

The good news is, thanks to my lighter schedule, I <em>should</em> have more time to get back to my creative interests.  I might finally be able to improve on <em><a href="http://http://www.cudascubby.com/ld28/">The Lonely One</a></em>, like I wanted to ages ago.  And of course, I will be working on <em><a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7925160/1/The-Sun-Chronicles-The-Power-of-Silence">The Power of Silence</a> </em>as soon as I possibly can.  I will be purchasing a Chromebook soon and that should improve my writing habits.  Basically, it's a laptop that's extremely portable, boots in a few seconds, and is designed for fast computing on the go.  Perfect for writing, if you ask me.

And in other news, the next <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> is about two months off.  I'm already looking forward to making another game.  I've discovered a couple of tools that will help me greatly this time around.  I'd like to make something with random generation, but we'll see how that goes.

The only thing that really stands between me and sweet, sweet freedom now is finding a job.  I've got a couple of leads going for me now, but nobody has decided to extend me an offer yet.  Even so, I'm thankful there are so many opportunities right here at home.
