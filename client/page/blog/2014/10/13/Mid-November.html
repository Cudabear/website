This is one of my favorite times of the year.  The temperature is just starting to get nippy but not too cold, the first snowflakes have begun to fly but not accumulate, signs of the upcoming holidays continue to pop up but it's no longer too early to complain about them.  I've been really enjoying walking to work the past week or so, enjoying the sights and sounds of the city and the fall weather.

So, what of my NaNo novel?  It turns out, even though I was greatly inspired by my novel, things just kind of fell apart shortly into it.  I lost track of what I was trying to do quickly, probably because I didn't make a more-detailed plot diagram before starting, and right now I'm stumped at 6,000 words when I'm supposed to be cresting at 25,000 in two days.  It's pretty clear I'm not making it this year, but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop writing.  I may drop this current idea but I still have <em>Volition</em> sitting at two thirds complete, and I know just how to finish it off.  Next year I'll make sure I have a more detailed plot planned out before starting like I did with <em>Volition</em> and <em>The Speed of Darkness.  </em>When I know exactly what I'm trying to do, it seems that the writing comes much more easily.

So other than being the halfway point of NaNo, what's the significance of this particular November?  In about a week it'll be six months since I graduated college.  What have I accomplished during that time?  Quite a bit, actually.  At least, the important stuff is out of the way.  My wife and I are working hard to pay down our loans, living within our means, focusing on staying close with our families now that we lead independent lives.  It's all good and solid, that's for sure, but how does it look on my roadmap?

Truth is, I've been waiting for an opportunity to undertake a big project like <em>The Sun Chronicles </em>was for some time.  Other, more important stuff, kept coming up.  Weekends fill up now before I'm able to even to decide what I'm going to do on them, errands fill the time I have after work, chores squeeze themselves into any available spaces.  Even so, it's not like I don't have any free time, it just comes in small amounts.  An hour before bed, two hours between work and errands, some time in the morning.  Putting that time to actual use has been the hassle, and if I were taking advantage of it this whole time I'd have more to show for it.

Things aren't going to change any time soon, just get more busy.  So that's why I've decided to start a new game development project, something that, after gaining experience on the technology over the last year or so, I've realized is practical and potentially successful.  This will be a mobile game involving penguins (of course) and will have RPG and story-driven elements, coupled with dungeon crawler-like gameplay.  I'm really looking forward to getting a start on it!

This means I probably won't be participating in Ludum Dare #31, which is taking place early next month.  I have some plans already that weekend, and I'm not going to push the envelope on it.  Instead, I'll use the time to work on this new game project, which I've already begun drafting designs for.  I feel good about this project in particular, as all the problems I've encountered in my game development efforts in the past are handled.  I know the technology I'm working with, the scope seems reasonable, and I feel genuinely inspired to create the game.  So be looking for updates about it in the near future.  For now, the code name is <em>MobilePenguins</em>.<em>

Time to get back to work...
