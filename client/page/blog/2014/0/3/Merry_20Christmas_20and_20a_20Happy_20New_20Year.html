So I may be a little late on the Christmas season, but I figured and update post is overdue.  Massive rambling coming up.  You've been warned.

This have been very calm and relaxing throughout winter break for me, and it has been much appreciated.  I am trying to cram in 18 credits this quarter in order to guarantee I can graduate on time.  There are no second chances; if I fail any of my classes I'll be forced to graduate a quarter late.  Thereby this break has been much needed, even if I'm only 1/3 of the way done with my winter quarter.

During senior year at my university, all engineering majors have to participate in something called "senior design", which involves inventing and building something to solve a practical problem.  Being a software engineer, this involved building some kind of software system for me and my team.  We decided to build a social network for connecting volunteer efforts, and we're quite happy with how it's turning out.  Still, in order to pass the senior design "course" each quarter, you have to log at least ten hours of work per week.  That means I'll be working nearly as much as I do at my part-time internship during school, just to pass a 3-credit course every quarter.  Add the fact that I'm attempting to swollow Advanced Differential Equations for my math elective, American Literature for one of my remaining humanities electives, and Accounting for my application domain, and I've got my plate more than full.

I'm also taking web apps, however, which has been hilariously easy so far.  Our last lab was to write a coin-flip simulator in JavaScript.  The lab before that was to design a relatively simple HTML webpage.  While some people in the class have little experience with web development, it is almost exclusively where I have my development experience since I wrote my first html markup when I was in 6th grade.  I remember building guild and shop pages for Neopets back in the day.

Of course, now that I'm ridiculously busy, I've been having great inspiration to finish <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7925160/1/The-Sun-Chronicles-The-Power-of-Silence"><em>The Power of Silence</em></a>.  I've been fighting off massive writer's block with it over the last 6 months.  I felt as though I backed myself into a corner because of my unguided writing since around chapter 30.  I feel it's mostly because I rely on the prophecy told in chapter 5, but it is very specific.  If I deviate by any amount to make things interesting, I risk ruining the driving force behind much of the book.  Still, I think I've thought of a solution that will be shocking, yet not spoil the whole book.  It's not the path I was thinking of taking, but it should be great.  Look for updates from that soon, though I can't guarantee when because of school.

Part of the reason I've been so slow to get back to writing has been game development.  In the fall I took Mobile Applications development, focusing on Android.  Over the summer I had become sufficient with the technology, so the class was mostly review for me.  However, many of the labs were open-ended and allowed me to investigate OpenGLES and mobile gaming.  I created a simple android star-jumping game that I hope to polish and release as a free toy one day soon.  I was planning to port it to the Ouya, too, but my Ouya's micro-usb port (for hooking into the computer and loading APKs) broke off.  Oh well.

After my dabbling in android, I decided it was time to stop playing around.  I was tired of spending all game development time attempting to write simple game engines and not actually designing games.  I knew there were plenty of free game making frameworks out there, and decided it was time to learn one.  After some simple research, I picked up <a href="http://www.photonstorm.com/phaser">PhotonStorm's Phaser</a>, a great javascript/html5 canvas/webgl framework for making 2D games.  It's exactly what I was looking for.  It provides great Physics built in, efficient and dynamic tile-loading, and quick sprite rendering.  Best off all, what you create in it can be played in any modern web browser from anywhere with an internet connection.  I hope to soon make a permadeath mini-mmo in it, but that's a long way off.  Before I even attempt that I need to try to make a more simple multiplayer game.

I did, however, use Phaser for my <a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld28/">Ludum Dare 28 Game</a>.  You can read more about that in my previous post.   It was great fun to make, and it's a great feeling knowing I created a game from scratch.  As of writing this post, the voting for Ludum Dare 28 ends in 3 days, then I'll be able to know how my game rated against the other entries.  I'm not sure how far it will go, but I'm excited to find out!

Looking forward, I'm excited for the new year.  This is the year I'll be graduating and going forward into the software industry.  I hope to work for a company for a few years, gain connections and skills, and then break off and create my own startup.  Whether it will be an indie gamedev company or something else, I've yet to find out, but I have high hopes and dreams.
