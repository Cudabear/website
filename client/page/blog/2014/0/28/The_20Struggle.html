Hello everyone,

I apologize for the lack of posts that have much to do with my work or <em>The Sun Chronicles</em> lately, but I've been ridiculously busy over the past few weeks, and it's only getting worse as the weeks wear on.  This will be another meta post; I feel talking about my situation will make it a little easier to continue working.

I'm currently in my second to last quarter at MSOE, and in order to ensure I can graduate on time, I've had to take 18 credits this quarter.  This means I'm taking essentially 4 electives and one core class in addition to my senior design, which already has a mandatory 10 hr/week requirement.  Needless to say, I've been having trouble keeping my head above water.

I think I've been doing a good job so far, but in the weeks since I got back from Christmas vacation, I've been on a downhill slide.  The work is just piling up, and though I feel I've been working quite hard on it, I am still falling behind.  I'm unable to do very well on tests because I'm too busy doing work for other classes to study.  I'm having trouble maintaining a grip of my senior design project because I'm getting its tasks confused with labs from my electives.  It's disheartening, grueling, and extremely stressful.

The only thing that's keeping me going at this point is perhaps the simple fact that it's almost over.  It's currently mid-week 7, which means I've only got 3 and 1/2 weeks left until I'm basically done.  The only nice thing about having so many electives at once is that I will only be required to take two final exams.  And after that, I will only have fifteen credits to take next quarter, most of them again being electives.  While it doesn't seem like a big difference at a glance, these electives won't require any lab time unlike the electives I'm currently taking.

My hard work is already beginning to show signs of paying off, though.  I've interviewed at a local software development company for a Android development position, and they seem relatively interested in me.  Likewise, the idea of working for them is really growing on me.  I have a final round of interviews approaching shortly.  I'll be hoping for the best, as having a job lined up for this summer will take a huge weight off my shoulders.

I realize now that it's already been a month since the last chapter of <em>The Sun Chronicles</em>.  I've had small pockets of time to attempt to finish the next chapter, but I just have been lacking all motivation.  I hope that my workload will become lighter in the coming weeks so that I can post a new chapter soon.  That, and work on one of the billion project ideas I have in my head for various apps and games.
