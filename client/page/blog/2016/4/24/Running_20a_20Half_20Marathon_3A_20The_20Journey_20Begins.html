Hi, All!

If you follow my blog, you'll know that I usually only post things related to writing and game development, particularly Ludum Dares.  I've posted a few life events, as well.  Recently, I started running for exercise.  That said, it didn't take long for it to evolve into something far more recreational.

As of today, I've decided to start training for running my first ever half marathon this November.  This is a big deal for me, because before I started running last February, I couldn't run more than a mile without having to stop.  As of yesterday, I was able to run 12.75km (8 miles) before I was too tired to continue.  And I'm only a little over three months in!

If I can continue at that pace, the half should be a breeze.  I've already set a goal for myself to complete it in under 2 hours (about a 5:30/km pace).  In order to achieve this goal, I've made myself a <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bFzkmb6T1WfYkJoNhF1VBkwCsu-3ccFfkmdboowqKOs/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">training plan in a spreadsheet</a> that I plan to update with my daily runs.  It gives me a gradual increase in kilometers per week from my current 33 to a healthy 50.  I also plan to do some interval (speed) training to increase my average pace and meet that 2 hour mark.

Hopefully, I'll be posting status updates here every couple of weeks.  Provided I don't fall off the track, it should be a great time.  I know I'm already amped up and want to get out and off to a <em>running start</em>.
