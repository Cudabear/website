Hey, all!

My wife and I just released our <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 35</a> game, <em>Transform! The Three Natures!</em>

It's about a shapeshifting blob trying to make its way through an obstacle course at the request of its master.  It uses soft-body physics and each form has unique properties that make them useful!  Be careful, though, you will run out of energy if you transform too hastily and will need to restart!
