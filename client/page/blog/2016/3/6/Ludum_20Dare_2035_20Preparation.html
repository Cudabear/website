Hey, all!

It's that time again.  <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 35</a> kicks off in only 9 days!  And of course, I'm not prepared in the slightest.  I need to take some time this weekend to prep my workbench and get a repository set up.

What's my goal this time around?  I know for sure I want to continue trying to make a well-polished, fun game.  I'm not sure what kind of mechanics I'll try to tackle this time around, but it may be fun to do something other than a platformer.  I really enjoyed making my <a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld33" target="_blank">Ludum Dare 33</a> game and I might try to make some kind of adventure game again.  After all, I really enjoy telling a story through the gameplay.

See you in just over a week!
