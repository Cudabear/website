Another <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> has come to a close!  This was the 34th dare, and the 6th one I've participated in.  I've been making games for Ludum Dares since the 28th.  I only missed Ludum Dare 31.

Normally, I enter the dare alone, to submit a compo game in 48 hours.  This time around, however, I had help.  My wonderful wife helped by making almost all of the art in the game, as well as helping to design the overall game itself.  That meant this time I submitted a game to the Jam, the other side of Ludum Dare.  It has relaxed constraints, and an additional 72 hours to submit.

For the first time ever in a Ludum Dare, there were two themes selected!  As unlikely as that sounds, two themes had exactly the same score upon the beginning of the dare.  These two themes were "Two Button Controls" and "Growing".  Now, typically I don't like themes that demand certain mechanics from the game, such as "Two Button Controls", but for some reason this inspired me.  After discussing the themes with my wife for some time, we decided to make a two-button puzzle platformer.  The plants were more or less to fulfill the other theme of "Growing" but also created an opportunity to fill the crucial platformer mechanic of being able to jump, without actually having a button to do so.  We don't really know why we selected a cat to be the protagonist, but I think it was more or less because we were trying to create a chill, relaxed mood that suited a puzzle platformer.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Ratings</h2>
The ratings for <em>Flutter</em> were quite good, actually.

The interesting thing about these ratings is, according to rank, they're considerably lower than my previous two best games, <em><a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld33" target="_blank">Patient Zer0</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld29" target="_blank">Clone Escape</a></em>.  However, by number these ratings are as high as or even higher than the ratings for either of these two games.  This is likely because the Jam both had more submissions than the Compo ever did, and also because I was against teams comprised of talented people to take on every role of the process, while our team only had two amateurs.  That said, I'm very proud of how the game performed.

<em>Flutter's </em>Overall score is higher than my previous best, <em>Clone Escape</em>, by 0.03, but lower in rank by 42 positions.  The Theme score is also a new personal best, blowing any of my previous attempts out of the water, and also the closest I've ever gotten to 4 stars in a category.  Innovation is a new personal best as well, beating out <em>Clone Escape</em> by 0.30 stars.  Mood was below <em>Patient Zer0</em> by about 0.20 stars; audio by nearly 0.60.  Humor is never really a category I aim for, so it's usually the lowest, but it was still only 0.30 stars below my previous best.

The coolness score stands out this time.  I actually rated enough this time around to be in the top 30% of game raters!  In past Dares, I've only been putting in enough effort to qualify for placement.  This time around, I tried to double my effort and rated just over 50 games.  I feel it was worthwhile, as I was able to experience much more from other participants and was also able to garner more ratings for my own game!
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Time Breakdown</h2>
As aforementioned, I had 72 hours to create <em>Flutter</em>, rather than the usual 48.  In addition to this, my wife was able to contribute nearly all of the time required to make art for the game, so I was further able to dedicate time to the actual creation of the game.  Here's how the time usage worked out.

<div id="attachment_243" style="width: 702" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/res/blog-img/2016/01/Capture-1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-243"><img class="size-full wp-image-243" src="/res/blog-img/2016/01/Capture-1.png" alt="The time breakdown for Ludum Dare 34" width="702" height="323" /></a><p> The time breakdown for Ludum Dare 34.  Note: this does not include the time spent by my wife on art and miscellaneous content.</p></div>

&nbsp;

During Dare 34 I opted to sleep about 6 hours per night on Friday and Saturday, and then get a full 8 hours for Monday.  I know sleep and working fresh is more important than using that time for continued development through exhaustion, so I made sure to rest up.  I also didn't take off work on Monday, so I lost solid 12.5% of the competition there as well.  It's unlikely I'll be able to dedicate PTO to Dares in the future, either; PTO is fairly tight this year for me.

The main development time is split into two halves, Core and Content development.  Core development is the development effort into mechanics, game utilites, and other such things that make the game <em>playable</em>.  Content development is the stuff that improves the player experience, things like animation support, polish, menus, ect.  All together, I was able to spend 22 hours on code, and that makes me happy.  This was largely because I only needed to spend 3 hours on miscellaneous art items and development placeholders, while my wife worked on the final art that exists in the game.  Without her, the game would not have been as awesome as it was when we released it!

Level design was a bigger time sink this time around.  As I've come to learn, level design in puzzle games is what can make or break the game, so it's important to get it right.  Furthermore, the game holds a total of 15 levels, the most I've ever provided for a dare game.  Music was just a small part of the weekend again, but I'm happy I spent the time there.  My music is very amateur, but I feel it adds a certain level of personalty to the game that would be missing otherwise.

I didn't break polish time out into it's own time category, because it's such a hard thing to measure.  A lot of my development time this time around went into making sure the game was great the first time through, so improvements were made all the time while I was developing.  Time <em>was</em> spent polishing, however, and it shows a big difference in the game.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What Went Right</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Following my development process and using my existing toolset.</strong>  I usually comment on how much I enjoy my workbench, and how well Phaser has worked for me in the past.  This time, however, I'd like to comment on how sticking to what I know has paid off.  Every previous dare I tried to pick up something new to use, and it usually resulted in some kind of time loss.  This time, I didn't introduce anything I needed to learn, and it helped me to feel much more confident about what I was making.</li>
	<li><strong>Using a content preloader list in Phaser</strong>.  This point is a bit technical, but between Dare 33 and 34 I improved my

Love it." width="349" height="141" /></a><p> nice and simple json-style data. Love it.</p></div>

workbench to abstract out the content that needed to be loaded into memory for the game.  This meant making a configuration object in the workbench that contained lists of the images, animations, audio files, and where to find them.  The advantage of this is I didn't spend any time making sure these were loaded; I just added them to the correct arrays and it just worked.  furthermore, when it came time to make the level-select menu, all I had to do was access this array and I could determine exactly how many levels there were and what they were called.</li>
	<li><strong>Using state switching religiously.</strong>  This time, I made sure to abstract as much of the game as possible into separate states.  This made development infinitely easier, as I wasn't forced to add weird logic to my update loops to figure what state the game was in.  Every state existed for one purpose and for one purpose only, and rarely did anything need to be hidden or not updated when a state was being executed.  In the end, the game has 8 total states!</li>
	<li><strong>More layers in Tiled! </strong>The more I work with tilesets, the more I learn how useful layers are.  Granted, they make the game slower overall, but the level of detail and layering that can occur with additional tileset layers is worth it.  This time around, I used a total of 5 layers, whereas previously I had used no more than 3.  In future projects, I plan to use 8 total layers.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Data mining</strong>.  I've always been curious on how people have been playing my games.  I've always known just how many people are hitting the page, but beyond that I'm blind.  This time, I installed Google Analytics event tracking to <em>Flutter</em>, so I could see just how people were playing, and when people were giving up on it.  The information gained was invaluable for both improving <em>Flutter</em> and also for building future games.  If you'd like to read the full write up I did on this aspect, <a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/#blog-id-227" target="_blank">check it out here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What went Wrong</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Collaboration.</strong>  This was the first time I've ever worked with someone on a concise project like this, so it was a learning experience.  When we first started, I kind of just told my wife to "make some sprites, put them on a sprite sheet, and we'll roll with it."  However, there were several more requirements that I had wrongfully assumed she knew to fulfill to get the art to work in the game.  As of a result, some of our time had to be used to restructure the art to work correctly with Phaser.  I should aim to better explain all of my requirements for a given piece of the puzzle.</li>
	<li><strong>Not adding a <em>pop</em> factor.  <em> </em></strong>The data from how people are playing <em>Flutter</em>, the reviews, and the ratings all seem to indicate that <em>Flutter</em> is "just okay".  I also feel like it's one of the most polished, most finished games I've ever released for the dare.  I feel like people weren't stunned by it because there was, indeed, nothing stunning about it.  It's a relatively simple puzzle platformer, the art gets the job done, there's not much special about the audio.  People agreed that it was "good", but not special.  Adding some additional visual effects, more diverse sounds, or better establishing the story of the game would have gone a long way.</li>
	<li><strong>Visual cues are important</strong>.  One problem players brought up time and time again, and was expressed in the data I collected,

<div id="attachment_246" style="width: 160" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="/res/blog-img/2016/01/Capture-4.png" rel="attachment wp-att-246"><img class="size-full wp-image-246" src="/res/blog-img/2016/01/Capture-4.png" alt="Jump on bees, or avoid bees? What does the sign say to you?" width="160" height="148" /></a><p> Jump on bees, or avoid bees? What does the sign say to you?</p></div>

was that the visual cues of the bee enemy in the game, as well as the thorn tile, weren't good enough.  Some went as far to say that the sign that shows a cat jumping on the bees and getting hurt made it look like the cat was <em>supposed</em> to do that, a-la Mario style.  Then, when they assumed it was crappy collision detection that prevented them from progressing, they gave up.  Furthermore, players also reported the bee enemy was hard to see, and the thorn tile collision was brutally large.  These mechanics could have used more polish to ensure the game wasn't frustrating.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
This Dare was my best one yet.  I'm extremely proud of the game my wife and I were able to put out in the scope of the Jam.  Even though it didn't rank as good as I had hoped, the ratings still showed this is a new personal best.  I'd love to improve the upon the what I've already built, fix the problems I listed, and release a fuller game, but I'm not sure that will be feasible with what's on my plate in the coming months.  I'll make sure to be back for Ludum Dare 35 this coming April, though.

Always looking to improve!
