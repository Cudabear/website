Another month has gone by already, and I can hardly believe it's already been an entire year since I started my journal, and very nearly one year since I finished The Speed of Darkness.  Time is just flying by, and I can't tell if that's a good or bad thing while I'm in college.

Regardless, the last month has been nothing but a fast decent, almost crash landing, into the real world.  Almost immediately after coming off the high of my wedding, I learned that my wife lost her job due to a merger at the company we both worked at.  I managed to keep mine, but my income alone wasn't going to be enough to support us.  About two weeks later she was hired for another job on her college campus (praise God), but it was still a shocker for us.  Only days after we got married it was like we were given a curve ball.

I had to jump back into my normal schedule pretty quickly immediately after the wedding.  It was pretty much the next week that I was back to sinking over twenty hours a week into work, and over sixty into school.  And now that I'm helping to care for a household for me, my wife, and our cat, I've never realized just how much work being in the real world is.

I lived with my folks right up until my wedding, and never really had much to worry about.  I could work far less hours without the concern of being broke and not have to worry about whether or not I'd have a job the next day.  The hardest part of my life was gathering enough money together to purchase school books, and now that's the least of my worries.  Now it's crazy to think that I've only seen my folks twice last month.  I haven't even had the time to entirely clean out my room, yet.

But am I unhappy with the drastic change of lifestyle?  Not at all.  After all, it was me and my wife's decision to get married when we're still in college; nobody forced this on us.  And actually, it doesn't seem all that bad.  I have such a great number of supportive people in my life that I can't go a day without being encouraged, and my wife helps me out where ever she can.  It's like even though now I'm in ' the real world', and have the workload to prove it, I'm almost happy to be there.  I feel independent and couldn't be happier with where I'm sitting.

My focus now is preparing to pack up and move into a new apartment with my wife.  We're currently staying in a two bedroom apartment with a pretty empty second bedroom, so we want to downsize and move closer to our schools.  That means, since it's such an awkward time to be moving, we'll be living in a tiny hole-in-the-wall studio for three months, before we can get into the one bedroom we really want.  It's nice, too.  I can't wait to move there in the summer.

How has this affected my writing?  It's definitely slowing it down.  I have been very inspired to write recently, but whenever I have a free hour or so to open up a document and tick away, I find myself either too fried to do so or that I've lost the inspiration I had.  This time last year I was pushing out chapters darn near every day, and I really do wish I could do the same now.  I'm very confident about the ending I have planned for TSC: PoS, but I just need to get there.  Curse you, bipolar inspiration!

Maybe living downtown in my new apartment will alleviate that <img title=":) (Smile)" alt=":)" src="http://e.deviantart.net/emoticons/s/smile.gif" width="15" height="15" data-embed-type="emoticon" data-embed-id="391" />.
