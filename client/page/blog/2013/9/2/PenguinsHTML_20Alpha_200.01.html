Hey guys,

This blog is swiftly becoming a game-dev blog, but I'm not so sure I'm sorry about it.  I'm really engrossed by the game development project I picked up recently.  If you haven't heard of it, I'm aiming to make a HTML5 game that's expansive and multiplayer.  So far it's in its infancy, but I've just released the first version, let's call it alpha 0.01.  You can find it <a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/penguinshtml">here</a>.

I don't have all the time in the world, so right now the game has only been tested in Chrome.  Funnily enough, it also works well in IE9 but not in Firefox.  Furthermore, it doesn't seem to work well on any mobile device.  These all will (hopefully) be rectified in future releases.

The game right now is very simple, you can click on the android guy and tell him where to go, and he'll go there.  The landscape is also randomly-generated (so sometimes the android guy spawns on a rock, and gets stuck) but is really just a collection of snow and boulders.  The landscape itself is pretty expansive (the release features 100x100 tiles, but I've successfully tested and ran 1000x1000 tiles!) thanks to a very optimized landscape-rendering system that I've spent most of my time on.

There is a crippling bug if you zoom out too far, so don't do that!  Eventually there will be a limit on how far you can zoom out, for sake of performance.  Also, the landscape won't render unless you click and drag to move it.  I'm not sure why that happens.

In the end, there will be lots to this game.  It's just a side project now because I've got so much else going on.  Really looking forward to seeing this project take shape, though :).
