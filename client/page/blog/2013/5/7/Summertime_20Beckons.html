The last time I wrote a post, it was shortly before moving into a new shoebox-sized studio apartment with my wife.  A lot has changed since then, and the lack of entries can be contributed purely to that.

Firstly, this blog and the website it lies beneath.  I spent a good amount of time designing and developing it.  I decided to build it myself from the ground up so that it'd have a more artistic feel to it, with this lightweight WordPress underneath for blogging purposes.  I think it turned out pretty well.  It's far from done, though.  I've got lots more ideas planned for it.  The first step is getting it to look better in Internet Explorer, though.

As developing the website ate up the majority of my free time during the close of the school year, I didn't get much opportunity to write for <i>The Sun Chronicles</i>.  I think that's a fairly good thing, though.  It really helped me to sit back for a while and think about exactly how I'm going to bring <em>The Power of Silence</em> to a close.  I think I have something spectacular planned.  Hopefully it will be.

After I had finished the website, my Wife and I finally were able to upgrade our tiny little studio to a full one bedroom just upstairs in the same building. That said, we had to pull everything we owned out of our parents' storages and bring them in.  Most of the first two weeks since Summer let out have been spent unpacking and getting organized.  We're making good headway, but the bedroom still looks like a warzone and I've got a few boxes of junk left to sort through from my old room, too.

The new apartment is really nice.  It's around five- to six-hundred square feet, with a nice sized kitchen and a huge walk-in closet off the main room.  I've set my little personal space (I like to call it my office) up in the dining room.  Being able to spread out and not work through clutter like we did while we were in the studio greatly helps the creative process.  I've been writing there for a few evenings lately.  It's very reserved, and I have a very nice view out the window directly in front of my desk.

That being said, moving forward I'm looking forward to finishing up <em>The Power of Silence</em>.  I think it's gone to long already, and I've still got a decent amount of length to write to get in all of the plot.  We're still at least ten chapters from the epilogue; I'll tell you that.  I hope to get at least one chapter out per week and finish it by the end of the summer.  Ideally I'd like to finish it sooner than that, but my wife and I have quite a few plans for the summer and I'm just not sure I'll have time.

In addition to that, I'll be taking a couple of summer courses.  They run from now until the end of July.  I hope they won't require more than 2-3 hours per week each, so that I don't have to sacrifice too much time I'd rather spend on writing or working on the website.  I only need a C in them to get the credits I need, so Lord knows I'll be putting in minimum effort to get that.

Overall, I'm excited for the summer.  It's my first summer living away from home, and I've got many fun things planned.  I've already planned a big gaming party at my apartment, now that I actually have room to entertain.  It should be a blast.
