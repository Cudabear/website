So, the much anticipated episode <em>The Penguin who Loved Me</em> of <em>The Penguins of Madagascar</em> made an appearance recently.  I heard rumors that it was leaked on YouTube before the official release on Nickelodeon, but I don't have access to the channel itself to verify.  Regardless, here's the links to:

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orC8SHGMy44">Part 1</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62t46R6ZbQc">Part 2</a>

They work as of the day I'm posting this blog, but no guarantee they won't be taken down in the near future.

<strong>WARNING: Spoilers Below!</strong>

<em>The Penguin who Loved Me </em>was a nice homage to the classic James Bond films; in fact, the title is a direct play on <em>The Spy who Loved Me</em>.  It was chuck full of the humor we've come to love and expect from a penguins episode, and had me laughing to tears.  However, this episode also offered something we've not seen too often before: a huge advancement in plot.

This episode offered plethora of huge stepping stones in terms of the show and the series.  The big ones were:
<ol>
	<li>Doris' first reveal and role,</li>
	<li>Confirmation that Doris is Blowhole's sister,</li>
	<li>Confirmation that Blowhole's first name is Francis,</li>
	<li>Manfredi and Johnson's first offical cameo,</li>
	<li>Advancement in the Kowalski x Doris pairing</li>
</ol>

Now, Doris is a character who has been talked about incessantly since her name was first dropped way back at the beginning of season one, so seeing her on screen for the first time was really exciting.  She seems pretty grounded but a little ditsy at times.  I feel her character greatly complements with the show so far, and she'll make a great addition.

Furthermore, we see the show's first persisting relationship form: Kowalski x Doris.  Sure there have been hints to other pairings between characters, and even some true relationships (Skipper x Kitka, Julien x Zoe) but they always expired by the end of the episode.  It will be interesting to see how this relationship plays out, particularly due to the hints earlier in season 2 that Skipper had some sort of affiliation with Doris, romantic or otherwise.

Now comes an interesting bit: Dr. Blowhole's first name is Francis.  I'm 99% sure his first name had never been mentioned before on the show, so this comes as a bit surprise because it seems as though Francis is the more accepted name for him in the fandom.  He's had a variety of names (he's named Emilio in <em>The Power of Silence</em>, though I had a feeling I should go with Francis, curses) throughout the fandom, but if I had to choose the most recurring name, it would be Francis.  Whether or not this is a coincidence has yet to be confirmed.

However, along with that, it's curious to see that Doris is in fact Francis' sister.  This was also something that was heavily recurring in the penguins' fandom.  Almost everyone seemed to agree that it made sense for Doris to be related to Blowhole in some way: niece, sister, ect.  I think it fits nicely with the show, and allows room for much more conflict later on.

The final big step in the show's progression is a cameo by Manfredi and Johnson.  They were only on screen for a few moments, but we can draw many conclusions about them.  First off, they are thoroughly battered and beaten: Manfredi's even missing a foot.  So, something bad had to happen, which coincides with the penguins' stories.  Furthermore, it was fairly

recent.  Next, we see they're locked in captivity, which means however they got beaten up, it ended with them somehow being captured by humans and brought into captivity, if not by choice.  We could even speculate that, because they're locked up in Blowhole's old zoo, they were placed there by the diabolical dolphin himself.  Finally, we see that they referenced the team as "Skipper and the guys" so they were well aware of Rico, Kowalski, and even Private.

It's a bold step for the show, revealing so much information in just one thirty-minute special.  I think it's a step in the right direction, though, and should help the fandom come up with some unique and new ideas for fanfictions.  It leaves a lot of room moving forward, and I'm anticipating coming episodes.
