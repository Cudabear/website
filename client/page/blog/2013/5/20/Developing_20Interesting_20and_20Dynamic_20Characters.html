This blog isn't exclusively reserved for my personal entries; I also hope to offer some useful and insightful advice on writing that I've picked up over my short time on this planet.  It isn't much, but I like to help out where I can.

For this first entry we're going to take a look at something that many authors fail to achieve: A dynamic, interesting, and attention-holding protagonist.

I like to look at the main character of a story as the staple that holds everything together, and also is the location for the reader to latch onto it.  In other words, without a main character, the story will fall apart and won't hold any reader's interest.  Sure, unique, interesting settings and complicated, shocking plots can offer the reader much, but without a main character in the middle of it all, most readers will ditch your story shortly into it.  Imagine if the <em>Harry Potter</em> series just focused on the conflict between Hogwarts, the Ministry of Magic, and the Death Eaters in general.  It wouldn't be nearly as good of a story; it would be like reading a fictional history book.

That said, there are a lot of sides to creating what we can truly define as a <em>good </em>protagonist.  The way I see it, there are three main traits that a main character absolutely requires to be a good staple for the story:
<ol>
	<li>A viewpoint, strong opinion, or personality trait that isn't ideal and needs to be changed.</li>
	<li>A want or need; something the character absolutely requires.</li>
	<li>Something holding the character back from getting what they want.</li>
</ol>
I'll explain each of these points in more detail.

As you may know, one of the crucial goals of any story is to convey some type of moral or message.  This is done through a change the main character experiences, either good or bad.  The character can even experience multiple changes, as long as they are relevant to the story.  Therefore, it is necessary that the main character has something about them that will be changed by the events of the story.  This can reflect anything related to the message or themes of your story.

Jessie Pinkman from <em>Breaking Bad </em>is a great example.  In the show, his decent into darkness is verbose and clear in his words and actions, and is a direct result of the tragedies and tasks he is subject to.  In the beginning he's just a stuck-up punk and doesn't care about anyone but himself.  In the end, however... well, you'll have to watch it to find out for yourself.

<div id="attachment_88" style="width: 240" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="/res/blog-img/2013/06/Frodo-the-hobbit.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-88  " alt="Frodo-the-hobbit" src="/res/blog-img/2013/06/Frodo-the-hobbit-300x151.jpg" width="240" height="121" /></a><p> "No, Gandalf! I won't go!"</p></div>

The second point here is that the character <em>wants</em> something.  If Frodo from <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> didn't want to destroy the One Ring, would it be an interesting story?  No, not at all.  It would be more or less a story about how Gandalf forcefully carried him to Mount Doom, while he complained all the way.

The character in your story must, at a bare minimum, <em>want</em> something.  Truely, however, they should <em>need</em> something.  That offers a lot more room for an interesting plot full of conflict.  It usually takes the shape of something horrible that will happen to the character or someone close to the character, such as death.  This helps the reader understand the character's motives and really offers them the opportunity to get attached to said character.  Now, this doesn't have to be entirely clear right from the beginning; sometimes it can be interesting to keep a character's motives secret from the beginning.  That doesn't mean the character <em>doesn't</em> want something, though.  It just means we don't know quite what they want yet.

Maybe she can play next time."</p></div>

The final point here, which is an extension of the second point, is that there must be some force holding the character back from getting what they want.  This almost always takes the shape of the story's antagonist, but there are a few exceptions.  Think about <em>The Hunger Games</em>.  Katniss wanted to save her sister from the games.  If it would have been easy as saying, "I don't think I'll participate," the story would have been over in chapter one.  There was the horrible idea of volunteering herself for the games hanging over Katniss' head, and she had to make the decision to risk herself to save her Sister.

The most simple form of an antagonist that holds back your character is an individual.  This is your typical <em>Good verus Evil</em> scenario.  How exactly this antagonist prevents your character from getting what they want is up to you.  There are even stories where these relationships aren't directly clear.  In <em>The Speed of Darkness</em>, the main character's goal is to kill the main antagonist.  The antagonist provides the resistance by simply evading the main character, while working to achieve his own goal.  So as you can see, the roles can seem backwards.

These three rules are, of course, very simplified.  Stories--particularly novels--can contain twisting plots that involve many different characters.  The key thing to remember is that you should be able to answer each of these questions about any such dynamic character.  If you can't, maybe it's time to reanalyze that character and determine if they're really necessary.  If they are, try to add something to the story that gives that character some color.
