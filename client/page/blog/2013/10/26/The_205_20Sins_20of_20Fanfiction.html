Hello, everyone!

I figured I'd get back to my roots and actually write something about writing.  Recently I've been reading a lot of pieces on fanfiction.net and some of them are astoundingly bad.  I decided to categorize my observations into 5 easy-to-avoid fanfiction tropes.

&nbsp;
<h3>Sin 1: Creating a Self-Insert</h3>
If you've got a budding idea for a few fanfiction involving yourself or a close friend inserted as a main character, you should abandon it immediately.  This may seem overly harsh but think about how many of these fics are buried into the depths of the internet daily.

You may be thinking, "But, Cudabear, I was going to make myself dynamic and totally not a Mary-Sue." You're wrong.  If you use yourself as a main character, you're setting yourself up for failure.  Heres why:  Good characters have flaws, and in order for you to introduce them when the character in question is yourself is to criticize yourself.  Even if you try your best to be honest with yourself, you'll always paint yourself to be someone bigger than you might be.  In the worst cases, these characters do actually become Mary-Sues, because they behave perfectly in every way.  This is not what makes a good character, regardless of the fifty obscure skills that you seem to have in the fic even though each of them requires a lifetime of practice.

Now, this isn't to say that you can't use some traits that you might find in a character based off yourself in your main character.  This is actually a good idea.  If you <em>can</em> spot flaws in yourself, you can use them to great effect in your fictional characters.  But remember, the characters are just that: fictional.  You want something you can mold, poke, and transform with your imagination.  Trying to do that to yourself is just awkward and doesn't translate well into fanfiction.<i>
</i>
<h3>Sin 2: Creating a High School / College Fic</h3>
When you're designing the setting for your fanfiction, you will normally consider many options.  You'll look at the setting, or some of the settings, that are canon to your fandom, you'll look at some ideas that might play well with those settings, and you may look at something that could contrast well with those settings.  What you shouldn't do is think to yourself, "What would it be like if the characters of [insert fandom here] went to my Highschool/College/University?"

I realize some fandoms actually involve stories, books, or movies that occur in an education setting.  That's great and fine.  Stick with it and go for the gold, but don't you dare decide that all the canon characters are suddenly, "going to transfer into my school."

This sin his highly related to the one  before it, and that's that fics with this type of setting usually are also self-inserts.  Even if they aren't, they're usually forced, awkward, and just plain bad.  They warp the canon characters so it makes at least a little sense for them to be in that setting, or in worse scenarios, they don't even do that.  Trust me, I've seen a fic where a band of mercenaries wind up in a high school because they were supposed to spy on a teacher.  It's just stupid.

If you're going to use a high school or college setting for your fic, really think it through.  Does it make sense with the canon material?  Will it make for an interesting story?  Does it make sense for the characters to be there?  If you find any doubts, consider a different setting.  It'll make for a much more interesting story in the end.
<h3>Sin 3: Using Multiple First Person Views</h3>
Nothing turns me off more than reading a fanfiction and coming across something like this:
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~--!~( CharacterA's PoV) ~!--~</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Then after reading for a short while in ChracterA's first person dialect, being shouted at again with the notion of:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>~--!~( CharacterB's PoV) ~!--~</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">So on, so forth until I can't even tell who is speaking anymore and I look for something else to read.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">First off, let me say that if you <em>ever</em> feel you need to interject something into the middle of a story that's not directly related to narration or character speech, you need to reevaluate the purpose of that statement.  There is litterally nothing you could say that can't be expressed through good writing.  If the point of view switches, you can easily make it clear with clever word choice, at least if you're using a third-person perspective at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is where my main gripe with these fictions is.  First person just does not play well when you're constantly switching whose eyes we're looking through.  There's no good way to identify who the next viewpoint is from without a stupid name-drop in a quote or one of those flow-breaking announcements of who is speaking.  It's difficult to read, and the first-person perspective often adds little to nothing when its constantly switching around.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Don't let this discourage you from using the first-person perspective if you want, though.  If you're going that route, strongly consider focusing on one character and one character alone.  If you want to show perspectives from a multitude of characters, consider using third person. There is no reason you can't express their thoughts from the third person as long as you make it clear who we're supposed to be sitting on the shoulder of.</p>

<h3>Sin 4: Inserting In-chapter, Inline Author's Notes</h3>
Another of the biggest turn-offs for me when reading a (<strong>A/N:</strong> This goes along with the previous point, where you interject text into a story that has nothing to do with it.) fanfiction is inline author notes.  See, wasn't it hard to read that sentence?

As aforementioned, there is literally nothing important enough that it needs to be inserted in the middle of your story.  It really breaks immersion, it's not funny, it's not informative, and it's really annoying.  The advice here is simple: save your author notes for the beginning and/or the end of each chapter.
<h3>Sin 5: Writing Quotations as Script Format</h3>
This one is a bit of a thinner line than the other sins, because I have read a couple of fics in script format that were quite enjoyable.  However, these fics stayed true to actual screenwriting, and by that it was pretty difficult to tell character inflection, and visualize settings and actions.  Screenwriting is designed to be concise, and the details worked out later.

To rectify this weakness, many fanfiction writers tend to use a screenplay/novel hybrid form of writing, where instead of neatly formatted quotations, we get name-announcing lines followed by actual dialog.  The rest of the story, however, reads like a novel with descriptions and actions occupying paragraphs if we're lucky.  The worst offenders will insert actions into italics mid-dialog.

If you want to actually write screenplay, more power to you.  You should then learn how to write screenplay.  However, almost all fanfiction readers will prefer a novel format for reaching your fic.  We like neat paragraphs, new lines for each quotation, and having quotations clearly indicated with quotation marks.  We like a story that flows easy and doesn't leave you rereading lines trying to figure out what the heck happened.
<h3>Bonus Sin: Don't <strong>EVER</strong> Create a Truth or Dare</h3>
Seriously.  If you're considering it, don't.  These fanfictions (if you can call them that) often times violate ever sin on this list.

That about sums it up.  I hope you're able to take some of these tips with you when you write your next fanfiction.  It will be a much better piece of work.
