On January 5th, 2013, I began married life with the girl of my dreams.  And wow; I'm excited for the future.

My wife and I met just over five years ago, during our sophomore year of high school.  We have been dating since April 10th, 2008.  Ever since that first date to a nearby pizza place and custard stand here in Milwaukee (which funnily enough, ended in me getting grounded for being out too late), we've grown ever closer.  We became engaged on May 22nd; I proposed to her while she sat in our favorite tree in our favorite park, which we revisited on our wedding night.   Even though it's been very nearly five years together, I it's never felt as real as it does now.

The wedding was spectacular; over six months of planning cultivated into by far the most fun night I've ever had.  The ceremony was perfect, the reception was even better.  The caterer accidentally dropped a good portion of the entree all over the floor shortly before dinner was due to be served, but even then I couldn't have asked for a better night.  Lights were hung all around the theater where it was held, and all of our guests were seated around penguin-themed tables.  After dinner the DJ played music and we danced well into the night.  Then we left for our hotel; a surprise gift from my family.  We stopped at Denny's for a midnight snack in my tux and her dress, where everyone assumed we had come from a homecoming dance (do we really look that young?).

The entire day felt so surreal that I had to pinch myself on multiple occasions to ensure myself I wasn't dreaming.  I cried when I saw the love of my life appear in the archway to the sanctuary, her arm hooked with her father's; my first time seeing her at all that day.   I laughed all night long: after the ceremony, before the reception, during the reception, in the car, and at the restaurant.  I don't think I even stopped grinning all day.  My brother and best man gave a roast-of-a speech during dinner and my wife's best friend and maid-of-honor gave an equally awesome one as well.  And when it was time to cut our cake, my bride shoved a giant piece right into my face.  And then I realized: it is real.  I'm married to the woman of my dreams, and I'll have her as a teammate, lover, and friend for the rest of my life.
