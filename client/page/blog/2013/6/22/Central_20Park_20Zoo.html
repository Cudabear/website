So, Google released their new version of Google Earth.  Call it Google Earth 2.0 if you will, this new map has the ability to render cities in an isometric 3D view, with the approximate height of landmarks uniquely visible.  Quite incredible!  Naturally, I looked up the Central Park Zoo:

Comparatively, Central Park Zoo from <i>The Penguins of Madagascar</i>:

It seems the place is much greener than the show gives it credit for.  The penguin habitat is pretty in-place, however.  That's pretty neat.  It also seems the zoo on the show is larger.

Go and check it out if you have a chance.  Not many places are rendered in 3D yet, but they're adding more every day.

Oh, and if you're wondering why I <i>still</i> haven't gotten a new chapter for <i>The Sun Chronicles </i>out yet, hang in there.  I promise I'll have one out by this Saturday!

...(maybe)
