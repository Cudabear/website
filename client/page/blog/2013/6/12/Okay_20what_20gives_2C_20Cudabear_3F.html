D'you remember when, nearly three weeks ago, I said I was going to make an effort to update <em>The Power of Silence</em> with a new chapter each Saturday?  I do.  And here I sit, already in violation of my promise.  The delay has been partly caused by my own laziness, but there is a more important reason, as well.<em>
</em>

I had preordered an OUYA console for a while, and it was released and came in the mail near the end of June.  (If you're not sure what an OUYA is, check it out <a href="http://www.ouya.tv/">here</a>.) I've always been attracted to game development; I made a couple of simple games in my time and also a couple more complex engines.  I never got too far with them, usually going hard for a week and then giving up.  The OUYA is great because it allows me to publish a game license-free.

Now at first I was hesitant about getting too involved, since OUYA runs off Android and I've had no experience with it.  So for giggles I set up the development environment and began toying with it.  Bad idea.  A week later I already had the (relatively simple) game engine about 50% done.  Of course this means I'd missed two Saturday updates, with hardly anything to show for it.

Just last night I was making assets for the game (landscape sprites, mostly) and I'm really thinking this project could be a success.   It's a long way off in terms of art, music, sound, and story scripting, but the coding I'd say is at least 60% done.  For this reason I hope to have a demo for it out by the end of the summer, if not sooner.

<a href="http://ouyaforum.com/showthread.php?4244-Penguin-Armageddon">Here's more information on the game, if you're interested.</a>

Don't worry <i>Sun Chronicles</i> fans; this whole project won't leave you hanging with nothing.  The game will have a loose story line that functions as a prequel to <em>The Speed of Darkness</em>.  You can expect to see Manfredi.  However, the canonical penguins won't be making appearances because I hope to monetize this project.

All of this said, I'll try my best to get the next chapter of <em>The Power of Silence</em> out by this Saturday.  It's a big one, and I don't want to keep you folks waiting any longer.
