Ugh.  Wisconsin is not known for having particularly cooperative weather, but this is getting a bit out of hand.  Tomorrow is the first day of spring and there's still about two inches of ice coating the ground.  And on top of that, the high for tomorrow is only twenty degrees Fahrenheit.  Le sigh.

Even though the weather has been pretty depressing, life hasn't been so bad.  My wife and I are now safely moved into our new apartment.  It's a shoe-box 12x14 studio with a tiny kitchen and bathroom, but it suits our needs for right now.  We get to upgrade to a beautiful one bedroom in the same building in June, but for now we're dealing with the space constraint.

Even so, it's really not that bad.  I wasn't particularly dreading moving into a studio (I was far more happy to be achieving independence) but I defiantly wasn't excited for it.  It's everything we need for now, though.  It's warm and safe, and that's what's most important of all.

I've been working on The Power of Silence off and on for the last few months, but I really haven't been able to give it as much time as I'd like.  After coming down from the stress and business of my wedding, it seems life has handed me a plethora of other problems.  I've still got school and work on top of it, too.  As a result, time has been an invaluable resource over the past two months, and I'm not likely to have much free time for a few more.  However, I'm still thankful that I can push forward and publish a chapter every week or so at least.

I do greatly enjoy writing The Sun Chronicles, but I've been thinking more and more about getting some original fiction out into the market, and I really think I need to hurry.  I've been talking about it for about a year now, and I'm still only a portion of a way through two (what I fell are very great) novels.  I want to focus on the shorter of the two over spring break, but we'll see how that goes.  I've got to help my in-laws move this weekend and probably the first weekend of my break as well, so I'll be fortunate for any writing time I can get.

As for now I'll just keep plugging away at school.  I've been blessed with a somewhat easy quarter this quarter (two of my classes barely have any graded work at all) and I'm going to try to take full advantage of the extra time.  I've got to take a few classes this summer to catch up on some missing credits, so I'll be strapped for time then, too.  I guess all I can do is plan things out well now, so that I'm not burnt out when that time rolls around.
