Hello, everyone!

I can't believe 2013 is already coming to a close.  It seems like it was just yesterday that I was sitting by the Christmas tree drinking hot cocoa last year.  Now it's almost time to do it again.  I guess what they say is true: time flies when you're having fun.

There's a couple of announcements in this post, foremost that I'll be participating in Ludum Dare 28, coming up on December 13th.  For those who haven't heard of it, it's basically a competition where you create a game in 48 hours or less.  If you want to read more than that, <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo" target="_blank">click here</a>.

I plan to live stream the event, provided I can live stream without experiencing horrible amounts of lag.  I'll have details posted about my twitch stream closer to the actual event.  I'll likely be working most/all of the night on Friday, all day Saturday, and as much as I can on Sunday.  I'll be sure to get some sleep Saturday night, at least.  Feel free to tune in, watch me fail at trying to make game art, and ask me any computer science-related questions.

In other news, I just discovered that the entire Penguins of Madagascar Season 1 and 2 are available to stream on Amazon Prime.  As someone who doesn't have regular cable (though I'm pretty sure they don't show PoM on prime time Nick very often anymore) I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.  So, I know what I'll be doing for most of the next week.

If you don't have Amazon Prime, and are a student, you can get a free trial (I think it's a month?) And then after that you can get it for a few dollars a month.  It bags you free shipping on most amazon orders and pays for itself if you do regular shopping on Amazon (&lt;/amazon-plug&gt;)

That about wraps it up.  Hope to see you next weekend!
