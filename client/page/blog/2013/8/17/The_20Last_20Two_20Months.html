Hello, everyone!

It's a shame to see that this blog has once again fallen by the way-side.  I have been having trouble finding the motivation to do much of anything productive recently, and the lack of updates has been a direct result of that.

So what have I been up to?  Mostly work and school, and in my free time video games.  My classes started last week, for my senior year at my university.  I'm excited to graduate and get out into industry, but also dreading this last year.  I have what my school calls a <em>senior design </em>project.  Basically, a couple of other Software Engineering students and I get together and invent something to help people out.  I'm excited to get started, but I know its going to be a lot of work.  Other than that, I'm still working the same internship as always.  In terms of video games, I recently acquired Dead Space 3 and Dead Island, both of which I've been actively playing now for about a month.

In terms of my writing, I've been greatly neglecting <em>The Power of Silence</em>.  It's not that I've been too busy to work on it, just that I've lacked any and all motivation to finish it.  I'm just not happy with how it's turning out.  It's long-winded, and straying from my original intention.  I <em>know</em> how I want to end it, I'm just not very happy with it.  Nonetheless, I will finish it when I finally get the motivation.

Otherwise, I have been slowly outlining my NaNoWriMo novel for this year.  If you're not aware, NaNoWriMo stands for National Novel Writing Month, and involves participants writing a 50k+ word novel in the space of a month.  Last year I tried to write a young-adult novel about free will, and though it went well, I never finished it.  I made it to about 30k/50k words.  This year, however, I've got a great idea for a Penguins of Madagascar horror survival novel.  It's going to involve Blowhole, zombies, death, and be utterly dark.  I hope that I can deliver this year, as I'm greatly looking forward to writing this one.

Finally, I've been continuing work on my little side-project game.  If you remember from a previous post, I was attempting to write it for Android devices, basing my design around the Ouya.  I discovered my approach was not ideal, however, and was quickly running into performance issues.  I tried to restart the project using OpenGL, which would increase performance, but that resulted in me scrapping the project entirely.

So I started the project over with the same idea in mind, but using HMTL5 canvas instead of Android.  I figured, for my first game and just a little hobby project, this was a great technology to use.  I thought it would be able to reach a larger user base than the Ouya.  It would also be far easier to eventually implement multiplayer support.

As you can see, the game is nearly where it was before.  I've still got quite a few things to do, but overall it is far more optimized than the Android version and, in general, I'm far more happy with it.

That's about all that's been going on with me.  Stay tuned for more updates.  It's unlikely that I'll post another chapter of <em>The Power of Silence</em> before November, when I start working on this new story.  Until then, I'll continue working on this game.
