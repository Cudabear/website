So, <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo">Ludum Dare 33</a> has come to a close!  For those who aren't familiar, Ludum Dare is a game programming competition that takes the space of a weekend, either 48 or 72 hours depending on which half of the competition you decide to enter.  I decided to enter the compo, the more-strict 48 hour solo competition.

My game was <em>Patient Zer0</em>, a top-down exploration and survival horror game about a doctor that wakes up in the middle of a zombie apocalypse.

The theme this time around was "You are the Monster".  It was the kind of theme I've been waiting for, broad enough to be interpreted in many, many ways.  It didn't restrict the game that I was going to make, only guided it.  I've been wanting to make a survival horror game for a while, so I figured this would be a good opportunity to take on the challenge.  I knew it would be a difficult thing to make within the span of 48 hours, due to the amount of content typically in exploration games, but I also knew I could save time by making simple, polished mechanics.

Overall, I decided to use the theme to drive the story of the game.  I won't describe how for fear of spoiling it if you haven't played, and also so I don't sully your interpretation of it.  It seems many people struggled with the concept I put forth, or just didn't like it in general.  As a result, my Theme rank suffered.  However, it's always a bit hard to rank high under the theme category without getting into the upper 4's.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Ratings</h2>
So what were my ratings like, anyway?

<div id="attachment_199" style="width: 175" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/res/blog-img/2015/09/12033228_968750079849701_6907503668783155758_n.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-199" src="/res/blog-img/2015/09/12033228_968750079849701_6907503668783155758_n.jpg" alt="The ratings for Patient Zer0" width="175" height="235" /></a><p> The ratings for <em>Patient Zer0</em></p></div>

Overall, I'm very happy with how my game performed.  It ranked extremely high in the Audio and Mood categories, two of the areas I was most proud when I finished the game.  Graphics also was the highest I've ever received, and Overall was just slightly lower than <em><a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/ld32">Clone Escape</a></em>, my current highest-rated game of all time.  The fun rating was lower than I'd like, but I know my mechanics weren't very polished and the backtracking I required in the game probably wasn't very fun, either.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Time Breakdown</h2>
I was able to dedicate a nice portion of my time to the game this weekend.  Overall, I spent about 30 of 48 hours working on my game.  So how did my time usage breakdown go?

<a href="http://www.cudascubby.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Capture1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195" src="http://www.cudascubby.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Capture1.png" alt="Capture" width="684" height="276" /></a>

As you can see, I broke my time up pretty effectively.  I was able to get all of the work done within the span allotted, while still making sure I left enough time to get a couple breaks, eat healthy, and get about 6 hours of sleep each night.  You can also see that the content took just a long to develop as the core game engine and functions!  You'll also noticed I lost about 10% of my time to a car breakdown, which I'll explain more of later.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What went Right</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>My Workbench.</strong>  While I always made sure to get my environment set up before the event in previous Dares, I never had a proper workbench to start working off of.  Whereas before I had essentially a blank canvas on a stylized page with Phaser already loaded, now I had a proper skeleton code structure with a state-driven architecture and a preloader to boot.  All I had to do was start building my game directly, as all the overhead was done.  If you build Phaser games and want to check it out, be sure to do so <a href="https://github.com/Cudabear/ldwrap" target="_blank">here</a>.  Note that it is styled to look like my website, and also contains some resources specific to me (such as my logo).  These can easily be swapped out to match your needs.  I'll also be adding some improvements to this workbench in the future, such as a rudimentary UI construction library, lighting library, and fullscreen toggle.</li>
	<li><strong>Audio Creation:</strong>  I've been playing with making music in my spare time, and though I don't really understand it that well, I've been able to throw together some decent tunes in a relatively short time.  This time around I used <a href="http://online.boscaceoil.net/#!/" target="_blank">Bosca Ceoil</a>, a music creation software created by Terry Cavanagh.  It was easy to learn and contains a full library of great retro-sounding instruments.  Last time I used <a href="https://lmms.io/" target="_blank">LMMS</a>, which is more heavy weight.  I don't think one was, in particular, better than the other, but I think I'll be sticking with Bosca Ceoil simply because it's prebuilt for making tracks that fit right alongside the pixel art style I'll probably never deviate from.  Of course, sound effects were made with <a href="http://www.bfxr.net/" target="_blank">bfxr</a>, my go-to random sound effect generator.  I was more picky with the sounds I picked this time, and they suit the game well, even if there's only a few of them.  Here's the background music:</li>

<ul>
	<li><b>Using <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/" target="_blank">Tiled</a> to Define Content Triggers.</b>  A big sticking point for me when I was designing my code base was how I was going to factor in content and the triggers for this content.  In the end, I decided to use Tiled to apply properties on specific, invisible tiles that activate when the player collides with them.  This worked excellently, and I was able to quickly place these around the maps.  Everything in the game is defined this way, from simple dialog triggers, to items, to doorways.</li>
	<li><strong>Art Design:</strong>  I've always been a bit confused on how to make decent looking pixel art, and how to stick to a certain style.  Usually my style deviates from sprite to sprite, and in the end my game looks unpolished and rough.  This time around I took a few hours right off the bat to design most of my tileset and sprites.  They wound up looking pretty good, and that's reflected in my graphics score.  While I wasn't able to do as much as I wanted in this regard, what I did do really paid dividends and the game really looks creepy.  I'll be sure to design this stuff first when I'm fresh and most inspired again next time.</li>
	<li><strong>Simple AI.</strong>  A common problem I've had during my Dares is that I always try to go above and beyond with the enemy AI and path finding.  I usually sink three to five hours into this area of the game, when most of the time clean mechanics shines more than complex AI.  The zombies in <em>Patient Zer0</em> don't try to avoid obstetrical, they don't try to predict where you're going, and they don't move very fast.  They're zombies at their cleanest definition, and as a result, I spent minutes on their AI rather than hours.  If I had time, I knew I could have improved it during the polishing phase.</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>What went Wrong</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Not Polishing Core Mechanics</strong>.  While a lot of people appreciated the mood and idea of my game, they also despised the controls.  The main way of defending yourself, shooting your gun, is clunky and doesn't provide the player with much feedback about when you can fire, or when you're reloading, or where you're even aiming.  I didn't realize how bad this was until I came back to play the game after a few weeks, since while I was developing it, it felt okay.  If I would have taken an hour or so to properly design better shooting, reload, and aiming animations, perhaps my fun rating would have been higher.  As one reviewer put it, "You've got detailed chairs but I don't even know when I'm shooting my gun."</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>Not Holding the Weekend Sacred.</strong>  As you may have noticed on the time breakdown graph, I lost about 10% of my time to my car breaking down on Saturday.  Currently, my wife, my wife's sister, and I all share one vehicle so it's very important to keep it running strong.  I knew that the Dare also fell on a weekend where we make a cross-town trip to load up on monthly groceries at the nearest CostCo, but I didn't make an effort to go early so that we wouldn't have to worry about it.  Unfortunately, while we were on the freeway on the way back, our car blew a belt and we had to spend a good amount of time dealing with that, as well as arranging rides for the next couple days until we could get it repaired.  If I had gotten our errands done sooner, even if the car broke down it wouldn't have been across town and I wouldn't have lost nearly as much time.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><strong>No polish.</strong>  Overall, my time management was pretty good, but also could have used some improvement.  As a result, the core game was created within the 48 hour span, but when I released it, it was buggy and not polished.  Thankfully, I was able to fix the bugginess, a-la the rules of the Compo.  But the polish was sorely missing.  The game is missing much of the polish I wanted to add to it, such as a lighting system, additional weapons and enemies, better pixel art, and the like.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><b>Too much Small Picture Focus</b>.  When I was developing the code for Patient Zer0, I started off extremely well.  Thanks in part to my workbench, the code just fell into place and the architecture was easy to follow and understand.  However, as time went on, and I added additional features, I started throwing blocks of code in random places, restricting the execution with arbitrary boolean flags.  As a result, my code is very fragile and most of my bugs were caused by these boolean flags being incorrectly set at one point or another.  Furthermore, all of the content should have been stripped out into JSON format, but exists entirely within the JavaScript itself.  If, at all point while developing, I kept the big picture in mind, I could have factored out these blocks of code into their own objects and kept things much cleaner and more sturdy.</li>
</ul>
<div id="attachment_196" style="width: 624" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/res/blog-img/2015/09/javascript.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-196" src="/res/blog-img/2015/09/javascript.png" alt="Good JavaScript design." width="624" height="572" /></a><p> Good JavaScript design.  (this function goes on for another 150 lines.)</p></div>
<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left;"><b>Confusing Level Design.  </b>This one is something I knew would be a struggle, because I have never made an open-world game like <em>Patient Zer0</em> before.  I tried to give the player hints at where they needed to go next, but perhaps giving them free reign over the whole city from the start was a bit excessive and confused many.  This, coupled with the crippling number of zombies outside, meant they quickly got frustrated an gave up.  While I wanted to factor exploration into it, there just wasn't that much to encourage it when the supplies you received from doing so were less than you spent getting them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Conclusion</h2>
I think going for this style of a game, even with the time it required to make all of the content for it, was worthwhile.  I've always been more attracted by the story in games, so I've always wanted to create games that have the same level of depth to them as my favorite games.  I feel like I've scratched the surface here, and the experience I've gained is invaluable.  I'm already looking forward to the next Dare, where I hope I can do something on the same level as <em>Patient Zero</em>.
