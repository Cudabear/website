I know, big surprise, right?

It's been about seven months since I've even set foot into the codebase for the game, and though I'm already pretty far along in its development, times have changed and I'm not longer able to dedicate the kind of time required to make it a reality.

For those who have been following me for a while, I know I said the same thing about writing when I thought I wanted to do game development.  But now, another (and far less interesting) opportunity has come about, but it's the kind of opportunity I need to be able to move toward my goal of developing games for a living.  The truth is, game development is best left as a hobby as the industry is brutal and unpredictable.  Until in a state where substantial losses are bearable, I can't really dedicate to making a full-scale game.

That said, I'll still be participating in small projects and more importantly, Ludum Dares.  I still love game development, and every little game I work on gains me more and more valuable experience into the world of it.  Maybe someday, I can put it to good use.  But until then, I want to focus on this other opportunity.

I know not many people even knew about Inexorable's existence, but I apologize to those who were looking forward to it.  Maybe someday I'll finish it.
