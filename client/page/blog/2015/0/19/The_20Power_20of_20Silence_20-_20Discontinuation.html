It seems like it's time I finally put this story to rest.

It's been nearly a year since the last time I posted a new chapter, and I'll be honest, I haven't even started the next chapter. It's basically gotten to the point where I've forgotten how I was going to end this story. I have some notes that I took way back when I finished part one, but those are outdated and I've drifted too far away from them to be useful.

My mistakes were many: After finishing part one of the book, I took too long between chapters, didn't properly plan them out, and started incorporating additional subplots I never intended. Characters were running in circles, Private was loosing any redeeming qualities he had left, Dmitri and Irena were becoming useless, and the themes of the story became indistinguishable from the drivel I was writing.

For a while, writing this story became purely about the word count; hence why it has peaked at over 170,000 words. I padded out the length with moody and awkward conversations between characters that didn't move the plot forward. When things finally got going now near the end, I felt my characters were unlikeable, which is what I never intended.

Of course, this should be expected when writing a novel this long, right? The only reason <em>The Speed of Darkness</em> turned out alright was because I had made sure I had a detailed story outline before going into it, and stuck to it. Even then, it could use a lot of trimming and revision. <em>The Power of Silence</em> turned into a pile of steaming plot spaghetti with too many lines to track, so I never bothered to track them. I could cut some out and revise, but that brings me to a problem bigger than my own doubts in this story.

Time. I started this trilogy in my senior year of high school, way back in September of 2009. That was over five years ago. I've invested countless hours into this book series, and I have countless more to help it become a decent story. To even properly finish <em>The Power of SIlence</em>, I would have to write at least 25,000-30,000 more words. Then there's the third book, which would easily be another 150,000+ word monster. That's time I'm just not willing to invest in this medium anymore.

Don't get me wrong, I deeply, <em>deeply</em>, enjoyed writing this trilogy so far. I loved being able to craft my own story using some of the characters I've learned to love, giving them depth Dreamworks will always be too scared to even shake a stick at, making them feel real, concrete, <em>whole</em>. Making them make decisions I would be too scared to make. Putting them through the experiences I couldn't survive. It's been... magical. I don't regret it one bit.

As much as I enjoy writing, however, my true love is in storytelling. I love crafting worlds, storylines, and characters. Now that I'm out of college and I have the technical knowledge need to pursue it, I'm moving this love of mine to game development. Developing games that have stories that <em>mean something</em> has been my biggest dream since I was young. I always figured I'd never be able to obtain it. It was too farfetched, too hard to be an indie dev, too hard to become successful. Recently I've realized, my dreams are what I make them. All I have to do is reach out and take a chance.

So I'll be taking my time and moving it to developing a game. I'm about two months into a project already. The story of it is based off a PoM fanfiction idea I had some time ago but never fully wrote. It's going to have unique gameplay mechanics and it's going to tell a story, just like I always envisioned.

It's with a heavy heart that I finally say, I'm moving on. My only regret is that I will be leaving you, the readers of this trilogy, hanging on with no idea of how the trilogy will end. You won't even be getting the ending to this story. For that I say, I'm sorry. I'm deeply sorry. Your reviews are what kept me going, talking with you about elements, distinguishing how my writing could improve from you. You kept me going this long.

It is for this reason that I make this offer to anyone willing to take it: take this story up and run with it. Continue the storyline I decided to leave hanging. It's not over yet, unless you choose it to be so. Decide the fates of Private, Dimitri, and the others. It's up to you.

If you're interested in continuing <em>The Sun Chronicles</em>, or you're just curious, feel free to PM me for an idea of how I was going to finish this book and write the third. I've got a foggy memory of what I had planned originally, and I'll try to give you a good summary. I'll avoid putting that here, though, for fear of spoiling those who don't want to know about it.

Does this mean I'm completely done writing? Probably not. I really did enjoy writing this, and I've got some ideas still bouncing around my head. However, anything I do write will not be on this scale.

Again, it is with a heavy heart that I finally discontinue this story and its respected trilogy. I've appreciated each and every one of the reviews this story series has received. I've enjoyed creating this experience for you, and I hope you got something out of it, too.

If you want to follow the development of my upcoming game, feel free to follow it on twitter Death_Is_Fate. I post development updates there fairly regularly. I've also got a facebook, which you can find by searching Cudabear. Finally, feel free to check my website (linked on my profile page) for general news and full-length development rundowns on my blog.

Thank you all again. This journey has been a pleasure. I've grown so much with what I've received from this community. Maybe you'll see me around here again. Maybe you won't. Either way, I'll miss it.
