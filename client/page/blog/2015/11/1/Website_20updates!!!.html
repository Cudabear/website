Hey everyone,

You probably notice there's been a huge facelift to the website.  This is something I've been working on over the past few months and I'm glad to finally release.  The website was redesigned to adjust focus onto my game development efforts, as well as highlight any blogs that I write (and I do plan to write more, now that the redesign is out).

You'll notice the website is much more lightweight.  Whereas previously it was built using a heavy-weight library that was meant for webapps, now it's built using just JQuery.  It's still one page, so you'll notice the pages are designated by the hash in the URL rather than traditional paths.   Bookmarks and back/forward events work just the same, though.

The best part about the redesign: the site is responsive!  It should work on all mobile devices that have a modern browser, woohoo!

Looking forward to adding additional improvements in the future, such as twitter feeds and an functionality to play my webgames in-page.
