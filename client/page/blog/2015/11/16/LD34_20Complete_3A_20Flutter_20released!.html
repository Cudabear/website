<p style="text-align: left;">Hey all,</p>
I'm pretty late on posting this, actually, but LD34 is complete and I've posted my game: Flutter.  Well, actually this time around it's not just mine, my wife did almost all of the art and helped me design the game, too.  So this time around it's a Jam game instead of a Compo game.

Hope you'll enjoy it!
