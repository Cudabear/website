Wow, It's hard to believe yet another almost-six-month period has passed and I've, yet again, dropped off the face of the earth.  This is a result of a mix of factors, from moving, to work, to being uninspired in general.  And maybe, just maybe, I was a little lazy as well.

This said, I have been thinking quite a bit during my five months of secrecy.  It gave me a good opportunity to think out some projects I want to work on in the second half of this year, and I think I'm ready to tackle them.  The short version is: I'm going to be working on writing a short Penguins of Madagascar fanfiction while continuing to work on Inexorable.

Firstly, the fanfiction.  So, for those who don't know, I've officially discontinued <em>The Sun Chronicles</em>.  It's unfortunate, and I'm sorry for leaving those who really were excited to finish it hanging, but it's just not something I want to invest the kind of time that it required into.  You can read more about this if you want in the <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7925160/58/The-Sun-Chronicles-The-Power-of-Silence" target="_blank">final chapter I posted on fanfiction.net on <i>The Power of Silence</i></a>.  Essentially, I'm looking to instead use that time to work on becoming an indie game developer.

That said, I don't want to completely move away from Fanfiction and the Penguins of Madagascar fandom.  However, I will be significantly less involved than I have been over the last five years.  I have some ideas for a couple short stories, one of which, as mentioned before, I will begin working on soon, but they'll be just that--short stories.  Nothing novel-length anymore, as that kind of effort is what I'll be putting toward kicking off my indie game development career.

And what about that career?  So, I'm currently working on a turn-based strategy game called <em>Inexorable</em>, which I'm trying to make play a bit like an advanced form of Chess.  I was working very hard on it for a few months, but then I stopped working on it for about the last four months.  I'm ready to jump back in, however, so look for updates on the <a href="https://twitter.com/Death_Is_Fate" target="_blank"><em>Inexorable</em> twitter page</a>.

Lastly, I'll be particpating in both of the Ludum Dares and Nanowrimo as they occur later this year, so look out for a couple of new small games and (hopefully) my first successful Nanowrimo.  (Wishful thinking, perhaps?)
