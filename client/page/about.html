        Storyteller.  Novelist.  Game Developer.  Javascript Wizard.  All of these things very much indie.  If you hang around the places that I frequent, you may have heard of me at some point.  Then again, you also might not have.  The only thing that's important is that you're here now.

        If you're so inclinded, you can call me by my real name, Ryan Graef.  Otherwise, Cudabear is my screenname over much of the internet space.  Why that name?  It's the name of a childhood dog I had that passed away.  Regardless, if you see something with the name Cudabear on it, it's likely something I was involved in.

        What's all this about?  Why have I created this (admittedly gorgeous) website?  Why are you here?  Stop asking so many questions.

        Since I'm a self-proclaimed storyteller, let me sate your curiousity with a story:

            Storytelling is something that has been a part of being human before written history even existed.  Ever since we've been able to communicate, we've been passing along tales both big and small, fiction and non-fiction.  We've been spinning webs of adventures from our youth, about our dreams when we grow up, and even of fantastical worlds we can only visit in our dreams.  Stories are an integral part of what it means to be human.
        </p>
        <p>
            Stories have been a part of my life for as long as I remember.  Some of my earliest memories are of being entertained by the most wonderful stories my little brain could have ever imagined.  As I read books, watched movies, and listened stories from my family and friends, I gained inspiration to begin creating my own stories.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first attempt at storytelling was a novel that I wrote during middle and high school.  It was something that I never quite put enough effort into to see published, but am still happy I created.  After that, I got into FanFiction, which I found to be an amazing platform for getting something out into the public to recieve critisism and grow myself as a writer.  In the past couple years, I have transitioned from writing to game development, as I see great opportunities in interactive media to tell the kinds of stories that just can't quite be told in traditional writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The big picture isn't about just me, however.  The world is full of people all with stories unique to them that deserve to be told.  Everyone's got a chraacter or two buzzing around in their head that they'd like to share with someone else.  I believe it's extreemly important that we listen to those stories, that we encourage everyone to share those stories.  After all, stories are an amazing tool for bringing people together.

        Right now, I pretty much only create things as a hobby.  Primarily I focus on Ludum Dare, which is a triannual game development competition, which you can see my entries for on the <a href="javascript: void 0;" onclick="Utils.loadPage('games')">games</a> tab.  I also occasionally still dabble into writing, and anything I feel is worth sharing is found under the <a href="javascript: void 0;" onclick="Utils.loadPage('blog')">blog</a> tab.  I promise nothing you'll find is too scary.  Maybe.
